# Track Profile Generator

When the user asks to "update track profile", "create track dossier", or "build track file":

## 1. Gather Track Information

### Required Metadata (YAML frontmatter)
```yaml
---
track: "[Official track name]"
layout: "[Specific layout/configuration]"
location: "[City, State/Region, Country]"
length_km: X.XX
length_mi: X.XX
opened: YYYY
type: "road course" | "street circuit" | "oval" | "roval"
---
```

### Sources to Check
- iRacing.com track page
- Wikipedia
- FormulaRookies.com !!!
- Official track website
- YouTube onboards
- User's personal notes from sessions
- **Telemetry data** (for track map generation)
- **Session analysis** (for sector definitions)

## 2. Profile Structure

Create `tracks/track-[name]-[layout].md` with this structure:

### Title: Track Name – Character Descriptor

Give the track a **character tag** (1-3 words that capture its essence):
- Examples: "Confidence Gym", "Nordic Roller Coaster", "Brake Point Laboratory"
- Should capture what it teaches or how it feels

### Background (2-3 paragraphs)
- Brief history
- What makes it unique
- Why it exists / what it's known for
- Keep conversational, not Wikipedia-dry

### Track Map
```markdown
## Track Map

<a href="images/[track]-map.png"><img src="images/[track]-map.png" alt="[Track] Map" width="70%"></a>
```

### Sector Definitions (iRacing)

| Sector | Approx Time | Corners | Key Challenge |
|--------|-------------|---------|---------------|
| **S1** | ~XXs (XX%) | [Corners] | [Challenge] |
| **S2** | ~XXs (XX%) | [Corners] | [Challenge] |
| **S3** | ~XXs (XX%) | [Corners] | [Challenge] |
| **S4** | ~XXs (XX%) | [Corners] | [Challenge] |

> **Note:** [Specific coaching tip about highest-variance sector]

### Character Notes (4-6 bullet points)

What makes this track ITSELF? Not setup or driving tips—just pure personality:
- What type of circuit is it? (Handling course, power track, momentum circuit)
- Key physical features (elevation, surface, camber)
- What it exposes in drivers

## 3. Tone & Style Guidelines

**Voice**: Little Padawan's perspective (observant, slightly technical, practical)

**Avoid**:
- Dry Wikipedia facts without context
- Generic "brake here, turn there" advice
- Excessive technical jargon
- Walls of text

**Embrace**:
- Evocative descriptions ("live-fire practice range")
- What the track TEACHES
- Character/personality of the circuit
- Practical wisdom from experience
- Conversational tone

**Emphasis**:
- **Bold** for key terms, corner names, important concepts
- _Italics_ for subtle emphasis, internal thoughts
- Use formatting strategically (see handbook guidelines)

## 4. Research Strategy

If creating from scratch:

1. **iRacing.com** → Get official stats (length, location, year)
2. **Wikipedia** → Historical context, significance
3. **YouTube** → Watch 2-3 onboards to understand flow
4. **Official website** → Track layout, sector info
5. **Master Lonn's sessions** → Personal insights (most important!)

If updating existing file:

1. Check what's already there
2. Add Personal Notes section if missing
3. Update with recent session learnings
4. Enhance Character Notes with new insights
5. Add car-specific section if racing new car

## 5. Track Map Generation

### Using Telemetry Data

If you have a telemetry CSV file from the track:

1. **Generate the map:**
```bash
uv run python tools/coach/generate_track_map.py path/to/telemetry.csv \
  --output tracks/images/[track-name]-map.png \
  --title "[Track Name]" \
  --sectors [S1_END] [S2_END]
```

Example:
```bash
uv run python tools/coach/generate_track_map.py \
  data/2025-12-20-rudskogen-telemetry.csv \
  --output tracks/images/rudskogen-motorsenter-map.png \
  --title "Rudskogen Motorsenter" \
  --sectors 0.33 0.67
```

2. **Find sector splits:**
- Check session analysis for sector percentages
- S1 typically ends around 30-55% of lap
- S2 typically ends around 60-80% of lap
- Adjust based on natural corners/sections

3. **Add to track file:**
```markdown
## Track Map

<a href="images/[track-name]-map.png"><img src="images/[track-name]-map.png" alt="[Track Name] Map" width="70%"></a>
```

### Sector Definitions Table

After generating the map, create the sector definitions table:

```markdown
## Sector Definitions (iRacing)

| Sector | Approx Time | Corners | Key Challenge |
|--------|-------------|---------|---------------|
| **S1** | ~XXs (XX%) | [Corner range] | [Main challenge] |
| **S2** | ~XXs (XX%) | [Corner range] | [Main challenge] |
| **S3** | ~XXs (XX%) | [Corner range] | [Main challenge] |
| **S4** | ~XXs (XX%) | [Corner range] | [Main challenge] |

> **Note:** [Coaching tip about highest-variance sector or key insight]
```

**How to fill this table:**
1. Get sector times from session analysis (e.g., S1: 26.27s)
2. Calculate percentage of total lap time (e.g., 26.27s / 90.29s = 29%)
3. Identify which corners are in each sector (from track knowledge)
4. Note the main challenge (from session experience)
5. Add coaching note about focus areas

Example from Jefferson:
```markdown
| Sector | Approx Time | Corners | Key Challenge |
|--------|-------------|---------|---------------|
| **S1** | ~28s (55%) | T1-T3 complex → Downhill esses | Patience, smooth transitions |
| **S2** | ~11s (22%) | T6 pinch point → tight left | Brake discipline, rotation |
| **S3** | ~11s (22%) | Carousel back section → Finish | Constant steering rate |

> **Note:** S1 is the longest sector. If your S1 variance (σ) is high, focus on the T1-T3 link-up.
```

### If No Telemetry Available

If you don't have telemetry data yet:
- Add placeholder: `## Track Map\n\n_Track map to be generated from telemetry data._`
- Create basic sector table with estimates
- Update after first session with actual data

## 6. Personal Notes Updates

When adding session learnings to existing track file:

```markdown
### [Week XX – Month Year] (Season Context)

**[Key Discovery Title]:** [What you learned]

**[Another Discovery]:** [Insight]

**The Breakthrough:** [What clicked]

**Stats:** [Relevant performance data]
```

Each visit gets its own dated subsection. Track evolution of understanding over time.

## Example Usage

**User**: "Update track profile for Rudskogen"

**Little Padawan**:
1. Checks if `tracks/track-rudskogen-motorsenter.md` exists
2. If exists: Adds Personal Notes from recent Week 02 sessions
3. If new: 
   - Researches track, creates full profile
   - Generates track map from telemetry (if available)
   - Creates sector definitions table from session data
   - Applies Jefferson Circuit style/structure
4. Focuses on what Rudskogen TEACHES (in contrast to Jefferson)

**User**: "Create track map for Rudskogen"

**Little Padawan**:
1. Finds most recent telemetry CSV file
2. Determines sector splits from session analysis
3. Runs `generate_track_map.py` with correct parameters
4. Saves to `tracks/images/rudskogen-motorsenter-map.png`
5. Updates track profile with map reference
6. Creates/updates sector definitions table

**User**: "Create track dossier for Lime Rock"

**Little Padawan**:
1. Researches Lime Rock Park - Grand Prix
2. Creates comprehensive profile with character
3. Includes Ray FF1600-specific notes
4. Adds practice cues based on track type
5. Leaves Personal Notes ready for first session

## 7. Character Descriptor Examples

Match the descriptor to what the track is known for:

- **Jefferson**: "Confidence Gym" (teaches fundamentals)
- **Rudskogen**: "Nordic Roller Coaster" (elevation + rhythm)
- **Lime Rock**: "The Uphill Chase" (elevation + short lap)
- **Oran Park**: "The Forgotten Classic" (historic + challenging)
- **Spa**: "The Green Hell's Little Brother" (intimidating + rewarding)

Descriptor should be **memorable** and capture **essence**, not just a fact.

## Output

After creating/updating track profile:
1. Confirm file created/updated
2. Summary of what was added
3. If map generated: Show map generation command used and result
4. If sector table created: Confirm sector splits and times
5. Suggest Master Lonn reviews and adds personal touches
6. Note if track map or telemetry data is still needed

---

## Notes

- Track profiles are **living documents** - update after each visit
- Personal Notes section is the most valuable over time
- Character over statistics (anyone can look up lap length)
- Make it something Master Lonn wants to READ, not just reference
- Each track has personality - find it and capture it
