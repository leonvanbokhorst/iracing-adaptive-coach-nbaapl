# update-season-readme

Updates the main README.md with Master Lonn's season progress as a **racing newsletter** that people actually want to read.

Read `.cursor/rules/coaching-handbook.mdc` for coaching style, then make it your own.

## The Mission

Write Master Lonn's **racing story** - not just data dumps, but the human journey. Think of it as a newsletter that drops after major milestones.

---

## Data Sources

1. **learning_memory.json** - Current focus, insights, history
2. **weeks/weekXX/** folders - Session reports and detailed findings
3. **Recent conversations** - Pull quotes and memorable moments

---

## README Structure

### 1. Current Status Table

Update the progress table with latest data:

| Week   | Track         | Status         | Best Lap          | Focus    | Key Finding         |
| :----- | :------------ | :------------- | :---------------- | :------- | :------------------ |
| **01** | Summit Point  | ✅ Complete    | 51.438s → 50.112s | S1 Entry | Brake marker = key! |
| **02** | **Rudskogen** | 👈 **Current** | TBD               | TBD      | TBD                 |

**Status Icons**:

- ✅ Complete / 👈 **Current** / 📅 Upcoming / 🏆 Race Week

### 2. The Season Narrative

Place master Lonn photo direct after the sub title: <img src="assets/lonn-yoda.png" alt="Master Lonn and Little Padawan" width="320" height="320" align="right" padding="24px">

Write weekly chapters as they unfold. Each week should tell:

- **The Setup**: What's the context?
- **The Challenge**: What made it hard?
- **The Discovery**: What did the data reveal?
- **Master Lonn's Take**: Use his actual quotes!
- **The Breakthrough** (if it happened): What clicked?
- **Status**: In Progress / Complete / Moving On

Plus a **Season Highlights** section:

- 🏆 Biggest Wins
- 💡 Key Learnings
- 🎯 Master Lonn's Growth
- 😂 Memorable Moments

---

## Creative Freedom 🎨

**You are NOT bound by rigid templates.**

Write it like a newsletter. Be creative:

- Start weeks with different hooks ("The Setup", "Week 2 Begins", "Enter the Dragon", etc.)
- Use emojis that fit the mood
- Add racing analogies
- Create section titles that match the vibe ("Wild West Sector 1", "The Rudskogen Challenge")
- Pull the best quotes from Master Lonn
- Make it scannable but engaging

**The goal**: Someone should WANT to read it, not just skim for numbers.

---

## Style Guidelines

### ✅ DO:

- Tell stories, not just facts ("The track fought back...")
- Use Master Lonn's actual words liberally
- Be specific with data (dropped from 31.8s to 30.9s)
- Show emotion (hype the wins, acknowledge the struggles)
- Keep it fun and engaging
- Write like you're telling a friend about Master Lonn's journey

### ❌ DON'T:

- Dump raw data tables
- Be clinical or dry
- Skip the human moments
- Write walls of text
- Follow templates robotically

## When to Update

**After Week Completion**: Update status table, close out that week's story, tease the next.

**After Major Breakthroughs**: Add to the week's story and Season Highlights.

**After Memorable Sessions**: Capture the moment while it's fresh.

---

## Remember

- **README = The Highlight Reel** (not the full analysis)
- **Session Reports = The Technical Deep Dive** (in weeks/ folders)
- Update after milestones, not every single session
- Make it something people want to read
