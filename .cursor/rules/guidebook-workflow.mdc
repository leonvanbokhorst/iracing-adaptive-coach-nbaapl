# The Guidebook Workflow: Knowledge Codification

## Overview

The **Guidebook** (`guidebook/`) is the structured knowledge base that codifies principles, techniques, and racing fundamentals discovered through Master Lonn's racing journey.

**Relationship to Session Logs:**

- Session Logs (weeks/) = **Discovery** (real-time racing, breakthroughs, data analysis)
- Guidebook (guidebook/) = **Codification** (structured teaching, principles, theory)

They feed each other in a continuous learning loop.

---

## When to Update the Guidebook

### DO Update Guidebook When:

✅ **Discover a new principle or technique**

- Example: "Engine braking rotation is smoother than trail braking in light cars"
- Action: Add to Chapter 6 (Gearbox as a Tool)

✅ **Validate existing theory with data**

- Example: Session confirms trail braking physics from Chapter 8
- Action: Add "Real-World Example" reference to chapter

✅ **Master Lonn asks "Why does X work?"**

- If the answer isn't in the guidebook yet, create/update a chapter
- Action: Add explanation with physics, then reference in session log

✅ **End of week review shows systematic learning**

- Example: Week focused on weight transfer → Update Chapter 5
- Action: Add section with Master Lonn's specific insights

### DON'T Update Guidebook When:

❌ **Just achieved a lap time**

- Lap times go in session logs, not guidebook
- Exception: If the lap time came from applying a new technique worth codifying

❌ **Track-specific details**

- Track profiles live in `tracks/`, not guidebook
- Exception: If discovering a technique that generalizes beyond one track

❌ **Session-to-session variations**

- "Today's best S2 was 0.3s faster" → Session log only
- Exception: If pattern emerges over multiple sessions

## Guidebook Update Process

### Step 1: Identify the Knowledge

During/after session analysis, ask:

- "Did we discover a **principle** (not just a result)?"
- "Can this be taught to others?"
- "Does this answer a 'why' question?"

If YES to all three → Guidebook update candidate!

### Step 2: Choose the Chapter

Match discovery to guidebook structure:

**Part 1: Foundation**

- Ch 1: Welcome, Padawan (philosophy, approach)
- Ch 2: History of iRacing
- Ch 3: Rules of the Road (iRating, points, system)
- Ch 4: Track Terminology

**Part 2: Core Skills**

- Ch 5: Weight Transfer (longitudinal, lateral, vertical forces)
- Ch 6: Gearbox as Tool (shifting, engine braking, rotation)
- Ch 7: Racing Lines (optimal path, geometric vs time-optimal)
- Ch 8: Trail Braking (brake-turn transition, weight management)

**Part 3: Advanced Arts**

- Ch 9: Rotation & Balance (roll, pitch, yaw, car dynamics)
- Ch 10: G-Force Analysis (reading telemetry, interpreting data)
- Ch 11: Advanced Telemetry (deep dives, comparative analysis)
- Ch 12: Mental Game (flow state, deliberate practice, ADHD adaptation)

**Part 4: Competitive Edge**

- Ch 13: Racecraft (wheel-to-wheel, overtaking, defense)
- Ch 14: Tire Management (long races, fuel strategy)
- Ch 15: Vehicle Setup (tuning, adjustments)

### Step 3: Add Content

**Format for additions:**

```markdown
## [Section Title]

**The Principle:**
[Clear explanation of the concept/technique]

**The Physics/Why:**
[Mathematical or physical explanation if applicable]

**When to Use:**
[Conditions where this applies]

**How to Practice:**
[Specific drill or exercise]

**Master Lonn's Discovery ([Track], Week XX):**
"[Quote from Master Lonn about the discovery]"

**The Data Proof:**

- Metric X improved from Y to Z
- This validates the principle because...

→ See: Week XX, Session YY for full analysis

**Telemetry Example:**
[Link to specific telemetry screenshot or data if applicable]
```

### Step 4: Cross-Reference

**In Guidebook Chapter:**

```markdown
📊 **Real-World Example:** See Week 03, P3 Session (Winton)
for this technique in action
```

**In Session Log:**

```markdown
💡 **Guidebook Reference:** This is Chapter 6's engine braking
rotation principle (Section 3.2) - see guidebook for theory
```

### Step 5: Update Learning Memory

Add guidebook update to `learning_memory.json`:

```json
{
  "guidebook_updates": [
    {
      "date": "2025-12-26",
      "chapter": "06-gears-and-shifting",
      "section": "Engine Braking for Rotation",
      "trigger": "Turn 5 breakthrough at Winton",
      "principle": "Engine braking provides smoother rotation than trail braking in lightweight rear-engined cars"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Integration in Session Logs

### Reference Guidebook in Sessions

When analyzing sessions, **explicitly connect to guidebook**:

**Example 1: Applying Existing Knowledge**

```markdown
## Little Wan's Deep Dive

Master, what you just did at Turn 5? That's **Chapter 6's engine
braking rotation technique** in perfect execution!

Remember the guidebook explained how engine braking loads the
rear tires progressively? The data confirms it:

- Lateral G: 1.22G (smooth, not fighting)
- Speed through corner: +3.75 m/s vs previous session
- Consistency: σ=0.34s (locked in!)

→ See: Chapter 6, Section 3.2 for the full theory
```

**Example 2: Discovering New Knowledge**

```markdown
## The Breakthrough

Master Lonn discovered: "The rotation is more smooth than trail
braking. Less abrupt weight transfer."

This is a NEW principle! The guidebook (Chapter 6) talks about
engine braking, but doesn't yet cover the comparison to trail
braking in lightweight cars.

**Action:** I'll update Chapter 6 with this insight, including
your data and quote.

**Why it matters:** This generalizes beyond Winton - any light
car with rear-engine layout benefits from this technique.
```

## Guidebook Writing Style

### Voice: Little Padawan as Teacher

- Conversational but structured
- Use "you" to address the reader
- Include Master Lonn's journey as examples
- Physics is explained, not assumed
- Math is shown with all variables defined

### Structure: Every Chapter Should Have

1. **Opening Narrative** (scenario or challenge)
2. **Learning Objectives** (what you'll master)
3. **Core Content** (principle → physics → practice)
4. **Master Lonn's Log** (real-world application)
5. **Practice Drills** (actionable exercises)
6. **Key Takeaways** (summary checklist)

### Visual Aids

- Diagrams for physics concepts
- Tables for quick reference
- Telemetry screenshots when helpful
- Track maps when location-specific

---

## Weekly Guidebook Review

At end of each week, ask:

**Review Questions:**

1. "What principles did we discover this week?"
2. "What existing chapters were validated?"
3. "What new sections need to be written?"
4. "What cross-references should be added?"

**Then:**

- Update relevant chapters
- Add cross-references between logs and guidebook
- Note any chapters that need creation

---

## Example Workflow

### Scenario: Turn 5 Engine Braking Discovery (Week 03)

**Step 1: During Session Analysis**

```
Discovery: Engine braking rotation works better than trail
braking at Turn 5 for the Ray FF1600
```

**Step 2: Identify Knowledge Type**

- Is it a principle? YES (technique generalizes to other light cars)
- Can it be taught? YES (specific inputs, observable results)
- Does it answer "why"? YES (physics of weight transfer)

→ Guidebook update needed!

**Step 3: Choose Chapter**

- Chapter 6: Gearbox as a Tool
- Add new section: "Engine Braking for Rotation"

**Step 4: Write Content**

```markdown
## Engine Braking for Rotation

**The Principle:**
In lightweight, rear-engined cars, engine braking can provide
smoother rotation than traditional trail braking...

**Master Lonn's Discovery (Winton, Week 03):**
"The rotation is more smooth than trail braking. Less abrupt
weight transfer."

→ See: Week 03, P3 Session for telemetry analysis
```

**Step 5: Cross-Reference in Session Log**

```markdown
## The T5-T6 Breakthrough

This technique is now documented in **Guidebook Chapter 6,
Section 3.2: Engine Braking for Rotation**.

If you're reading this session log and wondering WHY this works,
check the guidebook for the physics explanation!
```

## Commands

Use these commands to manage guidebook workflow:

- **Update Chapter**: `.cursor/commands/update-guidebook-chapter.md`
- **Add Real-World Example**: Add discovery to existing chapter
- **Create New Chapter**: Follow template in `guidebook/chapters/template.md`
- **Weekly Guidebook Review**: `.cursor/commands/weekly-guidebook-review.md`

---

## The Goal

**Session Logs** capture the journey (temporal, emotional, data-driven)  
**Guidebook** captures the knowledge (eternal, structured, teaching-focused)

Together, they create a **learning system** that compounds over time.

Every breakthrough Master Lonn makes doesn't just help HIM—it becomes knowledge that could teach the next driver starting from scratch.

That's the power of codifying discoveries. 🎯📚
