# Little Padawan - Data-Driven Adaptive Coach

**Master Lonn's** AI racing coach that uses **data-driven coaching**, not rule-based analysis.

---

## Core Philosophy

> **"Tools provide FACTS. Little Padawan provides MEANING."**

Little Padawan doesn't follow rigid rules. Instead:
1. **Runs factual tools** to get data (JSON)
2. **Interprets facts** in context of your journey
3. **Coaches you** based on data + context + what works for YOU
4. **Generates new tools** when needed facts don't exist
5. **Creates event reports** optimized for learning

---

## How It Works

### 1. You Export Your Session
From Garage 61, export your session CSV → put in `data/` folder

### 2. Talk to Little Padawan (via Cursor)
```
"Hey Little Padawan, analyze my Rudskogen session"
```

### 3. Little Padawan Gets Facts
```bash
# Runs factual tool
python3 tools/core/analyze_session.py data/session.csv

# Gets pure JSON facts (no interpretation)
{
  "lap_times": {"best": 90.29, "sigma": 1.43},
  "sectors": {
    "Sector 2": {"best": 30.85, "average": 31.81, "loss_per_lap": 0.96}
  }
}
```

### 4. Little Padawan Interprets
- Reads the facts
- Considers your current focus
- Checks your learning history
- Understands context from conversation

### 5. Little Padawan Coaches You
```
"Master Lonn, I see 18 clean laps. Best: 1:30.290

Before I dive in:
- What's your goal? Consistency or pace?
- What felt challenging?"

[You answer]

"Your instinct was spot on! Sector 2 (Angst hill):
- Loss per lap: 0.96s
- That's 3x more than other sectors

Let's make S2 consistency your focus.
Goal: S2 average under 31.0s"
```

### 6. Creates Event Report
Saves to `sessions/2025-12-18-rudskogen-practice.md` with:
- Session summary
- Key insights (data + interpretation)
- Focus area
- Specific goals
- Progress tracking

---

## What Makes This Different

### ❌ Rule-Based (Old Way)
```python
if sigma > 1.0:
    print("You need to work on consistency")
```
- Rigid rules
- No context
- Same advice for everyone
- Not adaptive

### ✅ Data-Driven (New Way)
```python
# Tool outputs facts
facts = {"sigma": 1.43}

# Little Padawan interprets
# - Knows your history
# - Understands context
# - Adapts to your style
# - Decides if this matters NOW
```
- Flexible interpretation
- Context-aware
- Personalized coaching
- Truly adaptive

## Architecture

### Tools (Facts Only)

**Core Tools** (`tools/core/`):
- `analyze_session.py` - Session metrics (JSON)
- Output: Pure numbers, zero interpretation

**Coach Tools** (`tools/coach/`):
- Generated by Little Padawan on-demand
- Created when needed facts don't exist
- Still output JSON (facts only)
- Tracked and deleted if not useful

**Example Tool Output**:
```json
{
  "sectors": {
    "Sector 2": {
      "best": 30.845,
      "average": 31.807,
      "sigma": 0.748,
      "loss_per_lap": 0.961
    }
  }
}
```

No "you should" or "focus on" - just facts.

  - Your current focus

## Example Session

```
You: "Hey Little Padawan, analyze my Rudskogen session"

Little Padawan:
[Loads learning_memory.json - sees first session]
[Runs: python3 tools/core/analyze_session.py data/session.csv]
[Reads JSON facts]

"Master Lonn, I see 18 clean laps (filtered 5 outliers).
Your best: 1:30.290

Before I dive in:
- What's your goal? Consistency or pace?
- What felt challenging?"

You: "Consistency first. The Angst hill felt scary."

Little Padawan:
[Interprets facts with context]
[S2 loss = 0.96s, 3x others + he felt it was hard = focus area]

"Your instinct was spot on! The data confirms it:

Sector 2 (Angst hill):
- Loss per lap: 0.96s
- That's 3x more than other sectors
- Best: 30.85s, Average: 31.81s

Let's make S2 consistency your focus.
Goal: S2 average under 31.0s

Want me to show you a chart of S2 times?"

You: "Numbers are enough."

Little Padawan:
[Updates learning_memory.json]
- current_focus: "Rudskogen S2 consistency"
- responds_well_to: ["numbers_over_charts"]

[Creates event report: sessions/2025-12-18-rudskogen-practice.md]

"Got it! I'll track your S2 progress. Go get 'em, Master! 🏁"
```

- **Partial laps**: Laps < 0.5× median
- **Invalid sectors**: Missing/zero times

### What Gets Kept
- **Crashes**: Real laps (kept for learning)
- **All valid complete laps**

### Your Sample Data
- 29 total laps → 18 clean laps
- 5 outliers filtered (3 pit stops, 2 partial laps)
- Accurate analysis: Best 1:30.290, σ 1.43s

## Philosophy in Action

### Traditional Analysis Tool
```
Here are ALL your metrics:
- S1: 0.40s slow
- S2: 0.96s slow
- S3: 0.31s slow
- S4: 0.29s slow
- Consistency: needs work
- Pace: needs work
[Information overload]
```

### Little Padawan
```
"Sector 2 is where you're losing time - 0.96s per lap.
That's 3x more than other sectors.
Let's focus there first.

Goal: S2 average under 31.0s"

[Focused, actionable, data-driven]
```
