### Week 01: No White Lines, No Problem

**Summit Point Jefferson Circuit | December 11, 2025**

#### The Challenge Nobody Warned Us About

Picture this: It's your first session of the season. New track. New car. You roll out onto Summit Point Jefferson expecting, you know, **actual track markings**. White lines. Curbing. The usual stuff.

Nope.

Just dotted center lines and vibes. 😤

But here's the thing about Master Lonn—he adapts. Those center dotted lines? They became his new best friend. The track layout? He figured it out. The tricky esses section and that sketchy last corner? He survived them.

And most importantly: he asked the right question.

Not "Why am I slow?" but "**What should I work on?**"

That's the mindset, right there.

#### What The Data Said

**Best Lap**: 51.438s  
**Clean Laps**: 22 of 38  
**Theoretical Best**: 51.341s (already within 0.1s!)

But here's where it gets interesting...

**Sector 2 was ALREADY consistent** (σ = 0.51s). Master Lonn found the rhythm in the MIDDLE of the lap first. The flow section? Dialed. The technical bit? Sorted.

But Sectors 1 and 3? Welcome to the Wild West. 🤠

- **S1 Loss**: 1.61s per lap (entry phase)
- **S3 Loss**: 1.66s per lap (exit phase)
- **Combined Carnage**: 3.27 seconds of opportunity

Translation: The entry and exit need work. The middle? Chef's kiss.

#### Master Lonn's Take

> "Well this track was completely new for me. Feels like a carting track. Very technical. But also no white lines denoting the track, so the dotted white lines in the center became important to position myself. Tricky last corner and esses section. But I really like it, though not fast yet. Eager to learn, but what? Pace?"

#### The Game Plan

**Mission**: Sector 1 Consistency (Entry Phase)

**Why S1 first?** Because it's the biggest single opportunity AND it sets up the entire lap. Fix the entry, and everything downstream flows better.

**Goals**:

- S1 average under 29.0s (currently 29.85s)
- S1 consistency under 1.5s σ (currently 3.11s)
- Find ONE reference point and commit to it

#### The Vibes

This first session? Pure exploration. Learning where the track goes, building confidence, getting a feel for the Ray FF1600. And you know what? 22 clean laps at a completely new track with no proper markings? That's discipline.

The pace will come. The process is what matters.

**Status**: 🔥 In Progress - Reference point hunting begins

### 📊 Season Highlights (So Far)

**🏆 Quick Wins**:

- Found S2 rhythm immediately (σ = 0.51s - that's tight!)
- Within 0.1s of theoretical best on Day 1
- Adapted to track with zero visual reference points

**💡 What We're Learning**:

- Sometimes the middle clicks before the beginning (and that's okay!)
- Data confirms feelings: Master Lonn knew he wasn't fast, data showed exactly WHERE
- Reference points are everything—even if they're just dotted center lines

**🎯 Master Lonn's Evolution**:

- Asks "What should I focus on?" instead of "Why am I slow?" (Growth mindset ✅)
- Adapts creatively under pressure (no white lines = use center lines)
- Eager to learn but methodical about it

**😂 Pit Wall Banter**:

- "No white lines denoting the track" - Master Lonn discovering Summit Point's secret difficulty setting
- Little Wan: "That's just RUDE! 😤"
- "Feels like a carting track" - The most accurate description of Jefferson Circuit ever
