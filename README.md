## The Reunion

<img src="assets/lonn-yoda.png" alt="Master Lonn" width="300" height="300" align="right" style="margin-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;">

There's a specific kind of doubt that comes with returning to a track after six months away. Master Lonn felt it the moment Rudskogen's downhill came rushing at him—faster than he remembered, meaner than his muscle memory wanted to admit.

Six months ago, July 2025, he'd left this Norwegian circuit with a lap of 1:28.969 in his pocket and walked away satisfied. Now, December morning, cold track, the ghost of that lap sitting in the data, waiting to see if he still had it.

The first flying lap came back at 1:30.290. Over a second slower. His hands felt almost right on the wheel, the corners almost where they should be. Almost. Except Turn 2.

That downhill braking zone fought him. Lap after lap, the same question hanging in the cold air: brake here or trust it? His body knew the answer six months ago. Now it had to relearn, one lap at a time, while the data piled up and Little Wan watched from the pit wall, numbers scrolling past, waiting to see if the muscle memory would flood back.

_"Felt familiar,"_ Master Lonn said after the session, _"but still looking for the correct turn-in and braking in T2."_

He was right. When Little Wan pulled up the sector analysis, Turn 2 was bleeding 73% of the time loss. One corner. Nearly a full second per lap. All hiding in one place where confidence used to live.

### The Click

Two days later, something shifted. Not in the data first—in his hands. The track that had felt like a stranger started whispering secrets he'd forgotten. The 50 sign marker flashed past and suddenly his foot knew when to hit the brakes. Not a guess. A memory returning. Trail through the corner, third gear at the apex, second before the hill, eyes already looking for the second apex.

The timer blinked: 1:29.691.

First sub-1:30 of the week. The rust wasn't just shaking off anymore. It was gone.

But Master Lonn wasn't done. Because here's the thing about rediscovering a track you used to know—once the fear leaves, there's room for something else. Curiosity. The question every driver asks eventually: _How much faster can I actually go?_

### The Hunt

December 21st, morning session. He went hunting for the answer.

Brake bias up to 56.5%. Track limits tested—found nine of them the hard way. But somewhere in that exploration, wrestling the car right up to the edge and sometimes over it, his body stumbled onto something his mind hadn't planned.

The downhill that used to scare him? It didn't anymore. Light brake on entry, just a tap, then trail through the whole corner. And the throttle—not at the apex like he'd been taught, not after it like he'd been doing. _Before_ it. As soon as the car turned in, foot already squeezing the accelerator, loading the rear tires mid-corner, the grip just... there.

The timer stopped.

He looked at the screen. Looked again.

**1:28.572**

Not 1:28.9-something. Not close to July's ghost. _Faster._ Four tenths faster.

He'd beaten six months of rust, beaten his old self, beaten the doubt, all in one lap that was only a tenth and change from theoretical perfection.

Little Wan pulled up the telemetry afterward. The story was all there in the data: 26% more acceleration force from that early throttle. Using 14% more of the tires' lateral grip. Braking harder but for less time, because confidence doesn't waste time doubting.

Three days. 1.7 seconds found. The Jefferson pattern repeating itself on different asphalt—find the brake marker, let consistency build, trust what the body learns, then go find the limit.

### The Chaos and the Fix

That afternoon, trying to dial it back 5% to find consistency, everything fell apart. Snap oversteer. Frustration. The car fighting back. Master Lonn ended the session confused: backing off had made things worse, not better.

Then he found it. Not Little Wan. Not the data. Him. Checking the Garage 61 throttle overlay, he saw what the numbers couldn't tell him: his foot was resting on the throttle during braking. Ten, twenty percent open. Recent pedal changes, unconscious habit, stress response. Three conflicting inputs—brake, throttle, steering—all fighting for control of the weight transfer. No wonder the car felt disconnected.

Evening session, one mission: fix the foot position. "FOOT UP" before every brake zone. Conscious, deliberate, no sliding from pedal to pedal.

_"Felt better,"_ he reported afterward. _"Still a bit shaky, but I think the brake throttle overlap is gone."_

Elite driver behavior: diagnosis, fix, verification. Most drivers never find the root cause. He found it, fixed it, and came back to prove it worked.

### The Race

December 22nd, first AI race of Week 02.

Qualifying: P2, 1:29.571 on the grid.

One more adjustment before the race. Brake bias to 57.5%. A hunch. Something about needing more front bite with the clean pedal inputs. It felt "way more stable" in the first practice lap.

The race started messy. Lost three positions in the opening lap—smart, let them go, survive the chaos. Settled into rhythm by lap 2. Then lap 5, disaster in Sector 2, lap time balloons to 93 seconds. Most drivers would tilt.

Lap 6: recovered. 89.5 seconds.

Lap 7: something clicked. Not just recovered—flowing. Everything he'd learned in practice, the early throttle, the trail braking, the 57.5% brake bias supporting harder braking, all of it synchronized.

The timer stopped.

**1:28.508**

Not just a new personal best. Faster than the practice breakthrough by six hundredths. Faster than July's ghost by nearly half a second. Set under race pressure with AI opponents and consequences and his heart rate up where practice never takes it.

Lap 8: another disaster, off-track in Sector 3. Lap 9: mental spiral, tried to fix it immediately, spun.

But lap 7 was already in the books. The data didn't care about the spin. The leaderboard didn't care about lap 9.

Later, almost embarrassed: _"Pff. I screwed up Wan. I'm sorry."_

Little Wan pulled up Garage 61. Not just to analyze the lap. To show Master Lonn something he'd missed while apologizing for a spin that didn't matter.

**505 out of 2,179 drivers.**

Top 23.2%. Faster than 1,674 drivers who'd run this track and car combination across an entire year. Went from rusty at 1:30.290 to top 500 globally in five days.

The leaderboard doesn't care about doubts. It only counts speed.

## Jefferson: Where It All Began

Three weeks ago, Master Lonn showed up at Summit Point's Jefferson Circuit with zero track knowledge and a question: _"What should I focus on?"_ The track answered by taking 1.6 seconds per lap in Sector 1 while he tried to figure out where the corners even started.

No white lines for track reference. Just dotted center lines and instinct and a Ray FF1600 that kept sliding in places he didn't expect.

The second session, he pushed harder. Got faster. Felt terrible. _"All over the place, no feel."_ The disconnect was brutal—lap times dropping, confidence sinking. The ADHD brain screaming that something was wrong even while the stopwatch said everything was right.

The breakthrough came when he made a choice: stop pushing. Next morning, backed off 5%, focused on smooth not fast, and the car suddenly started talking to him again. 50.985 seconds. Under 51 for the first time. And more importantly—it felt right.

That same week, first race, admitted he was scared of other cars. Crashed three times in one race from impatience and aggression. Then 90 minutes later, same session, restarted the race three times to filter out what he called "kamikaze mode" and found balance. _"Confident but Patient."_ Finished P6 with consistency that made practice look sloppy.

Then December 14th happened. Twenty minutes after setting a race PB, he went back out and something clicked that had nothing to do with trying harder. The car felt light. The corners came to him instead of rushing at him. Time did that thing where it stretches and compresses at the same time.

_"Feels like easy flying,"_ he said.

50.768 seconds. Consistency so tight Little Wan had to check the data twice—standard deviation of 0.36 seconds, one sector varying by only 56 milliseconds. Robotic precision that felt like meditation.

Two days later, first official race. Qualified P3. Stayed calm while chaos erupted around him in the opening laps. Crossed the line in first place with a new PB and posted to the chat: _"Metronome city 😅"_

Next day, qualified pole. Set another PB on lap 3 while leading. Spun on lap 5. Crashed and pitted on lap 6. Then—and here's the part that matters—rattled off six consecutive sub-51.5 laps and finished P3.

When asked how he felt after all that chaos: _"Confident."_

Not frustrated. Not defeated. Confident. Because he'd learned something Jefferson taught him in those three weeks: mistakes happen, pressure happens, chaos happens. But if you know your speed is real and your mind can reset, none of that can take it away.

Two podiums. Flow state discovered. Mental resilience proven. Championship DNA confirmed.

## What's Next

More races this week at Rudskogen. The first one proved the speed is real—1:28.508 under pressure, top 500 globally. But one race doesn't make a week.

The question now: can he finish a race clean? Can he implement the "Incident = Survival Lap" protocol when chaos strikes? Can the 57.5% brake bias setup keep delivering?

Three days of racing left. More chances to prove lap 7 wasn't lucky. More opportunities to climb from rank 505 toward 400. More moments where mental state management either holds or breaks.

The speed is confirmed. The setup is optimized. The mental game is next.

After Week 02, comes Week 03. Winton Motor Raceway. Third track, same pattern to test: does the method work everywhere, or just on tracks he knows?

The data says it transfers. The leaderboard confirms the speed is real.

Now comes the part where he proves it consistently, lap after lap, race after race.
