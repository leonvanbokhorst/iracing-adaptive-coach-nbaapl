# Understanding iRacing's Championship Standings and Point System

iRacing employs a detailed and multi-layered system for its championship standings, designed to reward both skill and consistency. This document provides a comprehensive overview of how the Championship Standings and Overall Season Standings work, including the intricate point system that forms their foundation.

## Championship Structure

iRacing's official racing is structured into four 12-week seasons per year. At the end of each season, champions are crowned in various series and divisions.

There are three main types of championships a driver can compete for in a ranked series:

- **Overall Championship:** This is the main championship for a given series, where all drivers compete against each other for the top spot.
- **Division Championship:** To ensure fair competition, drivers are placed into one of 10 Competition Divisions based on their iRating (a measure of skill). This allows drivers to compete against others of similar skill levels for a division-specific championship. Rookie license holders have their own 11th division.
- **Time Trial Championship:** For those who prefer hot-lapping, each ranked series also has a separate Time Trial championship where they compete for the fastest lap times.

## The Point System Explained

iRacing's point system is designed to be dynamic, taking into account the competitiveness of each race.

### Race Points

Points are awarded based on race finish position, weighted by two key factors:

**Strength of Field (SOF).** The average iRating of everyone in the split. Higher SOF → more points for every position. A win in a 1,400 SOF lobby might pay ~80 points, while the same win in a 4,000 SOF top split can pay 120–150 points. This is why some leaderboard drivers show 100+ points even with a single win — they raced in a stacked lobby.

**Field Size.** More cars, more points spread across the field and more reward for finishing well. P2 in a 20-car race is worth more than P2 in an 8-car race at the same SOF.

### Race Week Points

Your official score for a week is based on **the average of your best 25% of race results**, rounded up. That means you can run multiple times, but only the top finishes count:

| Number of Races in a Week | Number of Results Counted |
| :------------------------ | :------------------------ |
| 1–4 races                 | Best single result        |
| 5–8 races                 | Average of best 2 results |
| 9–12 races                | Average of best 3 results |
| 13–16 races               | Average of best 4 results |

So someone might run six races, but only their two best results feed the weekly total.

### Season Championship Points

Your Season Championship Points come from your **best eight** weekly scores out of the 12-week season, so a bad week (or a planned break) doesn’t kill your title hopes.

### Why Some Drivers Break 100+ Points

If you see someone with 120‑140 points after a single start, it usually means:

1. They raced in a high SOF split (3k+ average iRating).
2. They either ran multiple races and the 25% averaging kept only their monsters.
3. They might be in a higher division, but remember: division affects who you compete against, not the raw points you receive.

Your 80‑point win came from a 1.37k SOF, 10-car split – textbook solid result. To chase bigger numbers, you’d have to jump into stronger lobbies or keep stacking clean high finishes to boost your weekly average.

### Time Trial Championship

Separate from races: drivers run solo laps. First place gets 100 points, others scale down (e.g., 100/66/33 in a three-driver TT). Only your best eight TT weeks count toward the season title.

## Summary

1. **Single race points** scale with SOF and field size.
2. **Weekly points** average your top 25% finishes.
3. **Season standings** use your best eight weeks.
4. **Big numbers** come from high-SOF races and multiple strong attempts.

Understanding those levers lets you plan your attacks: pick the right time slots (higher SOF), run extra races to replace mediocre scores, and know when a safe banker finish is better than risking it all.
