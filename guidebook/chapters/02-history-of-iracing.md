# Chapter 2: A Brief History of the Digital Racetrack

**Narrative Hook:**

Master Lonn boots up iRacing for the first time in months. The loading screen appears—professional, polished, massive.

"Little Wan," he asks, "how did this become THE sim racing platform? Like... what's the story here?"

Little Padawan leans back. "Ah, Master. Sit down. This is a story about obsession, realism, and one man who refused to compromise..."

Welcome to the history of iRacing—from basement project to global phenomenon.

**Learning Objectives:**

- Understand iRacing's origins and founding vision
- Learn how laser scanning changed everything
- Discover the key partnerships that built legitimacy
- See how COVID accelerated sim racing's mainstream acceptance
- Appreciate the platform you're racing on today

## The Papyrus Legacy: Where It All Began

### The Obsessive Founder

**1987**: Dave Kaemmer, a software engineer and amateur racer (19 wins in Skip Barber Racing Championship), has a vision: create the most realistic racing simulation possible.

He founds **Papyrus Design Group** with one mission: no compromises on physics.

**The Philosophy:**
"If it doesn't feel like the real car, it's not good enough."

### The Legendary Titles

Over the next 15 years, Papyrus releases games that become **legendary** in sim racing:

**Indianapolis 500: The Simulation (1989)**
- First realistic racing sim
- Professional drivers used it for practice
- Set the standard for physics-based racing

**IndyCar Racing (1993)**
- Advanced tire model
- Real tracks
- Multiplayer via modem (cutting edge!)

**Grand Prix Legends (1998)**
- 1967 Formula 1 cars
- Brutally difficult, insanely realistic
- **Still** played by hardcore simmers today

**NASCAR Racing 2003 Season (2003)**
- The pinnacle of Papyrus work
- Physics so good it's STILL used as reference
- The code that would become iRacing

**Little Padawan's note:** Master Lonn, when you feel the Ray FF1600's realistic handling? That lineage goes back to these games. This is **decades** of physics refinement.

## The Birth of iRacing: 2004-2008

### From Papyrus to FIRST

**2002:** Papyrus Design Group closes (financial reasons, but the dream doesn't die).

**2004:** Dave Kaemmer partners with **John W. Henry** (owner of Boston Red Sox, Liverpool FC, and co-owner of Roush Fenway Racing) to found **iRacing.com Motorsport Simulations**.

**The Vision:**
Not another racing game. A **service**—like an online racing league that never sleeps.

**The Revolutionary Ideas:**

1. **Subscription-based** (not one-time purchase)
   - Continuous development
   - Always improving
   - No sequel treadmill

2. **Laser-scanned tracks**
   - Survey real tracks to millimeter accuracy
   - Every bump, crack, elevation change captured
   - First sim to do this at scale

3. **Structured competition**
   - Official series with schedules
   - Safety Rating (SR) system
   - iRating for skill-based matchmaking
   - Real consequences for crashes

4. **Professional partnerships**
   - NASCAR, IMSA, FIA licenses
   - Real car manufacturers
   - Real tracks

**Four years of development.** No game released. Just building, testing, refining.

## Launch and Evolution: 2008-2020

### The Launch (August 26, 2008)

iRacing goes live with:
- 13 cars
- 14 laser-scanned tracks
- A few thousand hardcore simmers
- A bold promise: "Most realistic racing sim ever"

**The Early Days:**

The community was **small** but **dedicated**. Subscription cost kept casual players away, but attracted serious racers.

**The critics said:**
- "Too expensive"
- "Too hardcore"
- "Won't work"

**They were wrong.**

### The Steady Growth (2008-2019)

Year by year, iRacing grew:

| Year | Milestone |
|------|-----------|
| **2010** | NASCAR partnership announced (eNASCAR series) |
| **2012** | 35,000 active members |
| **2015** | 50+ cars, 70+ track configs |
| **2017** | Porsche joins (Porsche TAG Heuer Esports Supercup) |
| **2019** | AI opponents added for practice |
| **2020** | 100+ cars, 100+ track configs |

**The Strategy:**

Every year:
- More laser-scanned tracks
- More licensed cars
- Better physics (tire model updates)
- More official series
- Better graphics

**Slow, steady, relentless improvement.**

## The COVID Moment: March 2020

### When Real Racing Stopped

**March 2020**: COVID-19 pandemic shuts down motorsports worldwide.

NASCAR, IndyCar, F1—all stopped. Drivers at home, bored, looking for something to do.

**Enter: iRacing.**

### The Pro Invitational Series

**FOX Sports** (yes, actual TV network) decides to broadcast the **eNASCAR iRacing Pro Invitational Series**:

- Real NASCAR Cup drivers
- Racing from home setups
- Broadcast on national TV
- Prize money
- **1 million viewers** tune in

**March 22, 2020**: Denny Hamlin wins the virtual Homestead race on live TV.

**The world notices.**

### The Explosion

**What happened next:**

- **March-April 2020**: iRacing adds 50,000+ members in weeks
- Servers overloaded (they add data centers globally)
- IndyCar drivers, F1 drivers, all racing on iRacing
- Mainstream media coverage
- iRacing becomes a **household name**

**By end of 2020:** Over 170,000 active members (5x growth from 2012).

**Little Padawan's note:** Master Lonn, you joined during this era! You're part of the COVID sim racing boom. The platform you race on today is what decades of work prepared for.

## The Technology Evolution

### The Three Pillars

**1. Laser Scanning**

iRacing pioneered taking laser scanners to real tracks:
- **Millimeter accuracy** (bumps, elevation, surface)
- Teams spend weeks at each track
- Data processed into 3D model
- Result: You're driving the REAL track

**Master Lonn's tracks:**
- **Winton**: Laser scanned 2016
- **Rudskogen**: Laser scanned 2021
- **Jefferson Circuit**: Laser scanned 2014

Every bump you feel? It's real.

### 2. Physics Engine

**Tire Model Evolution:**

- **V1 (2008)**: Basic tire physics
- **V4 (2013)**: Temperature-sensitive
- **V7 (2018)**: Dynamic surface modeling
- **V8 (2024)**: Real-time deformation

**Your Ray FF1600** runs on V7+ tire model—decades of refinement.

### 3. Multiplayer Infrastructure

**The Magic:**

- **60 Hz** physics updates
- **120 Hz** network updates (for low latency)
- Global server network (low ping worldwide)
- **Predictive netcode** (smooth even with packet loss)

**Why this matters:**

You can race someone in Australia from your home with **zero noticeable lag**. That's black magic engineering.

## The Partnerships That Matter

### NASCAR (2010-Present)

**eNASCAR Coca-Cola iRacing Series:**
- $300,000+ prize pool
- Path to real NASCAR opportunities
- Broadcast on TV
- Officialstep in NASCAR esports pyramid

### FIA (2020-Present)

**Official FIA Championships:**
- F4 Esports Championship
- GT World Championship
- Real FIA licenses awarded to winners

### IMSA, Porsche, IndyCar, etc.

Every major motorsport body now partners with iRacing.

**Why?**

Because the physics are **that good**. Pro teams use it for driver development and track familiarization.

---

## Why This History Matters to You

### You're Part of the Story

Master Lonn, when you race at Winton in the Ray FF1600:

- **The track:** Laser scanned, millimeter accurate
- **The car:** Physics refined over 20+ years
- **The competition:** iRating system from 15 years of development
- **The platform:** Built by the same mind behind NASCAR 2003

**You're not playing a game.**

You're using a **training platform** that professional drivers use, built on a legacy of obsessive realism dating back to 1987.

### The Future

**Where iRacing is going:**

- Better graphics (always improving)
- More tracks (new scans every year)
- Advanced weather (rain just added 2024)
- VR optimization (next-gen headsets)
- AI development (better offline practice)

**The vision hasn't changed:** Make it as real as possible.
