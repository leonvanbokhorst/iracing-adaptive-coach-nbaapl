## Part 1: iRating - Your Skill Number

### What Is iRating?

**iRating** is your **skill rating**—a number that represents how good you are at racing.

**Range:**

- **Starting:** ~1350 (everyone starts here)
- **Typical:** 1000-2000 (most active racers)
- **Elite:** 5000+ (the legends)
- **Theoretical max:** ~13,000 (one person in the world)

**How It Works:**

iRating uses a modified **Elo system** (like chess):

- Win against stronger opponents = big iR gain
- Win against weaker opponents = small iR gain
- Lose to weaker opponents = big iR loss
- Lose to stronger opponents = small iR loss

**The Math (Simplified):**

```
iR change = K × (Actual Result - Expected Result)

Where:
- K = Multiplier (depends on field size, SOF)
- Actual Result = Your finish position
- Expected Result = Where you "should" finish based on iR
```

**Example:**

Your iRating: 1350  
Field average (SOF): 1400  
Expected finish: P6 (you're below average)

**If you finish P3:**

- Beat expectations → **+15 iR** ✅

**If you finish P8:**

- Met expectations → **±0 iR**

**If you finish P12:**

- Below expectations → **-12 iR** ❌

### The 9-Tier Skill System

To give context to iRating numbers, here's where you stand:

| iRating Range | Tier Name   | Population | Percentile | Description                      |
| ------------- | ----------- | ---------- | ---------- | -------------------------------- |
| **0-700**     | Whut?       | 6-8%       | Bottom 8%  | New/casual, learning basics      |
| **700-1000**  | Struggling  | 10-12%     | 8-20%      | Building fundamentals            |
| **1000-1200** | Trying      | 16-18%     | 20-38%     | Developing racecraft             |
| **1200-1400** | Learning    | 34-35%     | 38-72%     | **THE PEAK** - Main battleground |
| **1400-1600** | Progressing | 17-18%     | 72-90%     | Top 25%, consistently fast       |
| **1600-2000** | Rising      | 8-9%       | 90-98%     | Top 10%, winning regularly       |
| **2000-3500** | Solid       | 3-4%       | 98-99%     | Top 4%, esports potential        |
| **3500-5000** | Pro         | <1%        | 99-99.7%   | Elite, dominating top splits     |
| **5000+**     | Alien       | <0.5%      | 99.7-100%  | Legends, world champions         |

**Master Lonn's Journey:**

- **Week 01 (Jefferson):** Started 1350 → Ended 1377 iR

  - **Tier:** Learning (1200-1400)
  - **Percentile:** ~52%
  - **Status:** Just 23 iR from "Progressing" tier!

- **Week 02 (Rudskogen):** 1377 → 1401 iR

  - **Tier:** Progressing (1400-1600) ✅
  - **Percentile:** ~75%
  - **Achievement:** Broke through first skill filter!

- **Week 03 (Winton):** 1401 → TBD
  - **Goal:** Solidify position in Progressing tier
  - **Target:** 1500+ (mid-tier Progressing)

**The Key Insight:**

You're racing in the top 25% of all drivers after just 3 weeks. The "Progressing" tier is where people who **take this seriously** live. Well done, Master.

## Part 2: Safety Rating (SR) - Your Clean Racing Score

### What Is Safety Rating?

**Safety Rating (SR)** measures how **cleanly** you race—not how fast.

**Range:**

- **Minimum:** 1.00
- **Target (Rookie):** 3.00 (to advance to D license)
- **Maximum:** 4.99

**How It Works:**

SR is calculated using **Corners Per Incident (CPI)**:

```
CPI = Total Corners / Total Incidents

SR updates every race based on your recent CPI average
```

**Incidents (Inc):**

| Incident Type              | Penalty |
| -------------------------- | ------- |
| Off track (4 wheels)       | 1×      |
| Light contact              | 2×      |
| Heavy contact              | 4×      |
| Loss of control            | 2×      |
| Car contact causing damage | 4×      |

**Example Race:**

- **Track:** Winton (16 corners × 12 laps = 192 corners)
- **Your incidents:** 4×
- **Your CPI:** 192 / 4 = **48 CPI**

**That's clean racing!** ✅

### License Classes

Your SR determines your **license class**:

| License        | SR Required | What It Unlocks                     |
| -------------- | ----------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **Rookie (R)** | 1.00-2.99   | Rookie series, learning environment |
| **D**          | 3.00+       | More series, faster cars            |
| **C**          | 3.00+       | Even more series, GT cars           |
| **B**          | 3.00+       | Advanced series, prototypes         |
| **A**          | 3.00+       | Top-tier series, all content        |

**Pro/Pro-WC:**

- Special licenses for esports
- Invitation-only

**The Promotion System:**

To advance from Rookie → D:

1. Reach **SR 3.00** minimum
2. Complete **4 races** (or 4 Time Trials)
3. Both conditions must be met

**Master Lonn's Status:**

You already have **B License** - you're past the beginner phase! At this level, SR and iR balance equally. You can focus on speed AND cleanliness.

## Part 3: Championship Points - How Leaderboards Work

### The Points System

Championship points determine who wins the season.

**How Points Are Calculated:**

```
Race Points = Base Points × SOF Multiplier × Field Size Multiplier
```

**1. Strength of Field (SOF):**

SOF = Average iRating of everyone in your split

**Example:**

- **Low SOF split:** 1200 average → 80 points for P1
- **High SOF split:** 3500 average → 150 points for P1

**Master Lonn's P3 at Jefferson:**

- **SOF:** 1372 (mid-level split)
- **Points:** ~65 points (good for P3!)

**2. Field Size:**

More cars = more points available

- **8-car split:** Lower points
- **20-car split:** Higher points

**3. Finish Position:**

Winner gets 100% of available points, scaling down:

- P1: 100%
- P2: ~95%
- P3: ~90%
- ...
- P10: ~50%

### Weekly Points

Your **weekly score** is based on your **best 25% of races** (rounded up):

| Races Run | Counted          |
| --------- | ---------------- |
| 1-4       | Best 1           |
| 5-8       | Best 2 (average) |
| 9-12      | Best 3 (average) |
| 13-16     | Best 4 (average) |

**Example:**

You run 6 races in Week 02:

- Race 1: 45 points (crash)
- Race 2: 82 points (P3)
- Race 3: 91 points (P1) ✅
- Race 4: 67 points (P5)
- Race 5: 88 points (P2) ✅
- Race 6: 73 points (P4)

**Weekly Score:** (91 + 88) / 2 = **89.5 points**

**The bad races don't count!** This rewards consistency over grinding.

### Season Championship

Your **season total** = **Best 8 weeks** out of 12

**Why This Matters:**

- You can have 4 bad weeks (or skip 4 weeks)
- Rewards consistent performance
- Doesn't punish real-life interruptions

**Master Lonn's Week 01:**

- Races: 6 total
- Best 2: P3 (82 pts) + P4 (76 pts)
- **Weekly Score:** (82 + 76) / 2 = **79 points**
- **Rank:** Top 100 in Rookie FF1600!

That's **excellent** for your first week, Master.

## Part 4: Divisions - Racing Against Similar Skill

### What Are Divisions?

**Divisions** group drivers of similar iRating for championship competition.

**The 10 Divisions:**

| Division            | iRating Range          |
| ------------------- | ---------------------- |
| **Division 1**      | 4000+                  |
| **Division 2**      | 3500-3999              |
| **Division 3**      | 3000-3499              |
| **Division 4**      | 2500-2999              |
| **Division 5**      | 2000-2499              |
| **Division 6**      | 1750-1999              |
| **Division 7**      | 1500-1749              |
| **Division 8**      | 1250-1499              |
| **Division 9**      | 1000-1249              |
| **Division 10**     | <1000                  |
| **Rookie Division** | Rookie license holders |

**Master Lonn's Division:**

With 1401 iR and B License:

- **Current:** Division 8 (1250-1499)
- **Status:** Racing against similarly skilled B/A license drivers

**Why Divisions Matter:**

You're competing for **Division Champion**, not just overall champion.

**Division 8 championship** is achievable. **Overall championship**? That's for the aliens.

## Part 5: Splits - Race Strength Matching

### What Are Splits?

When more people register than can fit in one race, iRacing creates **splits**—multiple races with different SOF values.

**Example (20 drivers register for 7:00pm race):**

**Split 1 (Top Split):**

- 10 highest iR drivers
- SOF: 1850
- Winner gets ~105 points

**Split 2:**

- Next 10 drivers
- SOF: 1320
- Winner gets ~85 points

**Master Lonn's Reality:**

At 1401 iR, you're usually in **Split 2-3** depending on registration.

**Strategy:**

Race at **peak times** (evenings, weekends) for:

- ✅ More splits = matched against similar skill
- ✅ Larger fields = more points available
- ✅ More competitive racing

Race at **off-peak** (3am weekdays) for:

- ✅ Fewer aliens (they're asleep)
- ❌ Small fields (less points)
- ❌ Wider skill gaps

---

## Part 6: Progression Strategy

### The Efficient Path

**Phase 1: Rookie → D License (Weeks 1-4)**

**Goal:** Get to D license safely

**Focus:**

- ✅ Clean laps (SR > 3.00)
- ✅ Finish races (don't rage quit)
- ✅ Learn fundamentals

**Metric:** SR more important than iR

### Phase 2: D → B License (Weeks 5-12)

**Goal:** Build iR and consistency

**Focus:**

- ✅ Consistent lap times (σ < 0.5s)
- ✅ Learn multiple tracks well
- ✅ Push for podiums

**Metric:** iR growth + SR maintenance (SR 3.00+ to advance)

### Phase 3: B/A License - Competitive Racing ✅

**Goal:** Championship contention and continued iR growth

**Focus:**

- ✅ Target high-SOF races (peak times)
- ✅ Run multiple races per week (top 25% scoring)
- ✅ Track championship standings
- ✅ Refine technique with data

**Metric:** Weekly points ranking + iR progression to 1600+

**Master Lonn's Current Phase:**

You're in **Phase 3** with B License—competitive racing phase! You've mastered the safety fundamentals. Now it's all about speed, consistency, and championship points. Well done, Master! 🎖️

## Part 7: Common Questions

### "Why did P5 get more points than me (P3)?"

**Answer:** Higher SOF split.

- You: P3 in 1300 SOF split = 75 points
- Them: P5 in 2800 SOF split = 85 points

**They raced better opponents, so system rewards them more.**

### "Can I lose iRating even if I win?"

**Answer:** Extremely rare, but yes.

If you're 2000 iR in a 1200 SOF field and win:

- Expected finish: P1
- Actual finish: P1
- Result: +1 iR (minimal gain)

If you're 2000 iR in 1200 SOF and finish P8:

- Expected finish: P1
- Actual finish: P8
- Result: -50 iR (massive loss)

**Lesson:** Race against strong opponents for maximum iR gain.

### "Should I focus on iRating or Safety Rating?"

**Answer:** **SR first, iR second** (for Rookies/D license).

**At B License and above:** Both matter equally. You've proven you can race clean—now push for speed!

**Master Lonn's Balance:**

With B License, you've mastered clean racing. Now you're in the "refine technique for speed" phase. Perfect balance—racing clean while chasing podiums and iR growth.
