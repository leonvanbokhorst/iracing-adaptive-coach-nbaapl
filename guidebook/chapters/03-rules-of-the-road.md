# iRating Tier System

**A Data-Driven Approach to Understanding Driver Skill Distribution in the FF1600 Rookie Series**

---

## Philosophy

The iRating tier system provides **meaningful context** for where a driver sits in the competitive landscape. Unlike arbitrary round numbers, these bins are designed to:

1. **Show detail where competition is densest** (1000-1600 range)
2. **Simplify where population thins** (below 700 and above 2000)
3. **Create motivating milestones** with descriptive tier names
4. **Reflect actual skill progression patterns** in the data

**Key Principle:** _"Bins should inform, not overwhelm."_

## Design Rationale

### Variable Bucket Sizes

**Why not equal-sized buckets?**

Driver population is **not evenly distributed** across iRating ranges. Using equal buckets (e.g., every 500 iR) would:

- ❌ Hide detail in the competitive range (1000-1600)
- ❌ Create empty/sparse buckets at extremes
- ❌ Make charts cluttered or uninformative

**Our approach:**

```
Low Range (0-1200):     200-300 iR buckets  → Show entry progression
Competitive (1200-1600): 200 iR buckets     → Maximum detail where YOU race
Mid Range (1600-2000):  400 iR bucket       → Transition zone
Elite (2000+):          1500+ iR buckets    → Sparse population, wider bins
```

## Tier Descriptions

### 🆕 0-700: Whut?

**Population:** ~6-8% of drivers

**Reality Check:**

This tier is typically **wreckers**, people trying to iRace with a **controller or low end wheel/pedals**, extremely suboptimal setups, or those who treat it like an arcade game or love to bother others. Also home to rage quitters who disconnect after a Lap 1 incident. If you're racing with a proper wheel/pedals and taking it even remotely seriously, you won't be here long.

**Characteristics:**

- Brand new to sim racing (or not taking it seriously)
- Trying to race without proper equipment (gamepad, low end wheel/pedals, etc.)
- Consistently causing incidents (often unintentionally)
- High incident rates (10+ per race)
- Extremely inconsistent lap times (5+ seconds variance)
- Frequent rage quits and early exits

**Typical "Driver":**

- Racing on a gamepad/controller (thumbstick steering in an FF1600... yikes)
- First time in a racing sim, treating it like Forza or Gran Turismo
- Not familiar with racing etiquette ("other cars = brakes")
- Using other cars as braking markers 💥
- The "what's a racing line?" crew
- Rage quitters who can't handle a T1 incident

**The Good News:**

If you have a wheel, pedals, and any desire to improve, you'll climb out of this tier in just a few races. The bar is LOW. Simply avoiding major incidents and finishing races puts you above most of this tier.

**Milestone to Next Tier:** +300 iR (very achievable with proper equipment and basic racecraft)

---

### 🏁 700-1000: Struggling

**Population:** ~10-12% of drivers

**Reality Check:**

You've escaped the chaos of the "Whut?" tier! Drivers here have proper equipment and are _trying_, but still struggling with fundamentals. You can complete a race without causing a massive pileup, which puts you ahead of the bottom 6%. Progress!

**Characteristics:**

- Building foundational skills
- Starting to string together clean laps
- Learning racecraft basics (when to brake, where to turn in)
- Still inconsistent (lap time variance >2s)
- Can avoid most incidents (but not all)

**Typical Driver:**

- Has wheel/pedals and wants to improve
- Can complete races without major incidents (usually)
- Knows the racing line exists (in theory)
- Working on consistency lap-to-lap
- Still making "learning mistakes" (braking too early, missing apexes)

**Milestone to Next Tier:** +300 iR

---

### 💪 1000-1200: Trying

**Population:** ~16-18% of drivers

**Reality Check:**

You're in the "trying to be competitive" zone. You can finish races cleanly and post decent lap times, but you're not consistently fast yet and spinning out regularly. You know what you _should_ do, but executing consistently is still a work in progress. This is where real racecraft development begins.

**Characteristics:**

- Developing consistency
- Learning setups and car feel
- Understanding tire management (starting to)
- Improving racecraft in battles
- Can avoid most incidents (sub-5 per race)

**Typical Driver:**

- Consistent lap times (variance <1.5s)
- Can race wheel-to-wheel without panicking
- Learning when to attack vs. defend
- Knows the fast line, working on hitting it every lap
- Starting to understand setup changes

**Milestone to Next Tier:** +200 iR

---

### 📚 1200-1400: Learning

**Population:** ~34-35% of drivers ← **THE PEAK!**

**Reality Check:**

Welcome to the main battleground! You've got solid fundamentals, you can race cleanly, and you're sometimes competitive in your splits. This is where **most sim racers plateau** - the difference between being "good" and "fast" is subtle and takes time to develop. You're battling thousands of drivers with similar skills, and that extra tenth per lap is HARD to find.

**Characteristics:**

- Main competitive battleground (THE most densely populated tier)
- Solid fundamentals established
- Refining racecraft and strategy
- Good consistency (variance <1s)
- Clean racing with low incident rates
- Know the tracks and can run race pace

**Typical Driver:**

- Knows most tracks in the series
- Understands basic setups (can make adjustments)
- Can race competitively in mid-pack splits
- Working on that "extra tenth" per lap
- Consistent podiums in lower splits, competitive in higher splits
- Clean racer (3-5 inc/race)

**Why This is the Peak:**

- Most drivers plateau here while refining skills
- The transition from "competent" to "fast" takes time and focused practice
- Represents the core competitive field - the "average good racer"
- Breaking 1400 requires genuine consistency improvements

**Milestone to Next Tier:** +200 iR (significant skill jump - this is a REAL filter!)

---

### 📈 1400-1600: Progressing

**Population:** ~17-18% of drivers

**Reality Check:**

You've broken through the first major skill filter! Only 1 in 2 drivers from the Learning tier make it here. You're not just competent anymore - you're **genuinely fast**. You can run consistent pace that challenges front-runners, and you rarely throw away races with mistakes. You're in the top 25% of all drivers.

**Characteristics:**

- Breaking away from the peak (-48% population drop!)
- Consistently fast laps (can run within 1s of optimal regularly)
- Strong racecraft and spatial awareness
- Top 25% of all drivers
- Rarely makes major mistakes (sub-3 inc/race)

**Typical Driver:**

- Can match pace of faster drivers in the split
- Rarely makes major mistakes (and knows immediately when they do)
- Understands advanced techniques (trail braking, weight transfer, etc.)
- Podium contender in most splits
- Starting to win races regularly

**The First Major Filter:** -48% population drop from Learning tier (consistency filter!)

**Milestone to Next Tier:** +200 iR

---

### 🚀 1600-2000: Rising

**Population:** ~8-9% of drivers

**Reality Check:**

Top 10% territory. You're not just fast - you're fast **and** consistent **and** strategic. You're winning races regularly, finishing on podium in top splits, and people know your name. This tier separates the "sometimes fast" from the "always fast." You're a legitimate threat to win any race you enter.

**Characteristics:**

- Top 10% of all drivers
- Fast AND consistent (both required now)
- Strong strategic thinking (tire management, fuel, race pace)

**Milestone to Next Tier:** +400 iR (BIG jump to elite territory)

---

### 🏆 2000-3500: Solid

**Population:** ~3-4% of drivers (Top 4%)

**Reality Check:**

You're **really good**. Top 4% of all drivers. This is what dedication and consistent practice gets you - you're not some unreachable alien, you're a serious sim racer who puts in the work. You win races regularly, podium in top splits, and you're respected in the community. People in your split know you're fast. This tier is **reachable** for any committed iRacer willing to put in the hours and focus on improvement.

- Deep understanding of car physics and setup
- Can adapt to new cars/tracks within a few sessions

**Milestone to Next Tier:** +1500 iR (huge gap to Pro - takes serious dedication and talent)

---

### 👑 3500-5000: Pro

**Population:** <1% of drivers (Top 0.8%)

**Reality Check:**

**This is where the "oh crap" moment happens.** People check who's in their split, see your name, and their heart sinks a little. You're **elite**. You dominate most splits you enter, you're winning in the highest splits consistently, and your name is recognized globally in the sim racing community. This is where casual "really good" ends and semi-pro/professional begins. You're one of the ~70 best drivers in your series out of 8,500+. You could compete in esports if you wanted to commit to it (or you already are).

**Characteristics:**

- Elite professional/semi-pro level (top 0.8%)
- **Dominating** top splits (wins or podiums almost every race)
- Esports-level skill (or actual esports competitor)
- Near-perfect execution (errors are rare and minor)
- Within 0.5-1% of world record pace

**Reality Check:**

You're one of **~20 drivers** out of 8,500+. You're a **legend**. Professional esports driver, world championship contender, setting world records. People watch your streams to learn. Your name is mentioned in sim racing forums daily. You're basically a sim racing god. There are Formula 1 drivers who would lose to you in a sim race.

**Characteristics:**

- The legends (top 0.3% of 0.3%)
- Professional sim racers (this IS your job)
- World championship contenders (and winners)
- Consistently within 0.1% of theoretical optimal
- Perfect execution, race after race

**Typical Driver:**

## How to Use This System

### For Self-Assessment

**Find your tier, understand where you are:**

- What % of drivers are you better than?
- What's your next realistic milestone?
- What skills define your current tier?

### For Goal Setting

**Use tier transitions as milestones:**

- Current tier: "Learning" (1200-1400)
- Next goal: Break into "Progressing" (1400+)
- Medium-term: Reach "Rising" (1600+)

### For Context

**Understand race performance:**

- "I'm in Learning tier racing against Progressing drivers"
- "I just beat someone from Rising tier!"
- "This split has 3 Solid tier drivers - tough field"

---

## Comparison to Other Systems

### vs. iRacing Divisions

iRacing divisions are **license class-based**, not skill-based. Divisions mix drivers of vastly different iRatings.

**Our tier system:**

- ✅ Pure skill-based (iRating only)
- ✅ Shows actual competitive distribution
- ✅ More granular in competitive range
- ✅ Consistent across all series

### vs. Round Numbers (1000, 1500, 2000)

Round number milestones are **arbitrary**. They don't reflect population density or skill progression.

**Our tier system:**

- ✅ Data-driven (based on actual distribution)
- ✅ Meaningful milestones (tier transitions = skill jumps)
- ✅ More informative for progression tracking

---

## Evolution & Tweaking

### Why These Specific Numbers?

The current bins evolved through analysis of actual Formula 1600 Rookie Series data (Season 01 2026, 8,510 drivers):

1. **Identified the peak:** 1200-1400 contains 34.5% of drivers
2. **Found the filters:** Major drop-offs at 1400 and 1600
3. **Balanced granularity:** Detail where needed, simplicity at extremes
4. **Named meaningfully:** Tier names reflect actual progression

### Can Bins Be Adjusted?

**Yes!** The system should evolve based on:

- Series-specific distributions (Rookies vs. Advanced)
- Personal focus areas (more detail in YOUR range)
- Visual clarity (too many bins = cluttered charts)

**Current bins optimized for:**

- Formula 1600 Rookie Series
- Drivers in 1200-1600 range
- 9 total tiers (readable chart)

---

## Technical Implementation

### Code Location

`tools/coach/visualize_irating_distribution.py`

### Current Bins (lines 47-58)

```python
bins = [0, 700, 1000, 1200, 1400, 1600, 2000, 3500, 5000, 15000]
bin_labels = [
    '0-700\n(Whut?)',
    '700-1000\n(Struggling)',
    '1000-1200\n(Trying)',
    '1200-1400\n(Learning)',
    '1400-1600\n(Progressing)',
    '1600-2000\n(Rising)',
    '2000-3500\n(Solid)',
    '3500-5000\n(Pro)',
    '5000+\n(Alien)'
]
```

# Understanding iRacing's Championship Standings and Point System

iRacing employs a detailed and multi-layered system for its championship standings, designed to reward both skill and consistency. This document provides a comprehensive overview of how the Championship Standings and Overall Season Standings work, including the intricate point system that forms their foundation.

## Championship Structure

iRacing's official racing is structured into four 12-week seasons per year. At the end of each season, champions are crowned in various series and divisions.

There are three main types of championships a driver can compete for in a ranked series:

- **Overall Championship:** This is the main championship for a given series, where all drivers compete against each other for the top spot.
- **Division Championship:** To ensure fair competition, drivers are placed into one of 10 Competition Divisions based on their iRating (a measure of skill). This allows drivers to compete against others of similar skill levels for a division-specific championship. Rookie license holders have their own 11th division.
- **Time Trial Championship:** For those who prefer hot-lapping, each ranked series also has a separate Time Trial championship where they compete for the fastest lap times.

## The Point System Explained

iRacing's point system is designed to be dynamic, taking into account the competitiveness of each race.

### Race Points

Points are awarded based on race finish position, weighted by two key factors:

**Strength of Field (SOF).** The average iRating of everyone in the split. Higher SOF → more points for every position. A win in a 1,400 SOF lobby might pay ~80 points, while the same win in a 4,000 SOF top split can pay 120–150 points. This is why some leaderboard drivers show 100+ points even with a single win — they raced in a stacked lobby.

**Field Size.** More cars, more points spread across the field and more reward for finishing well. P2 in a 20-car race is worth more than P2 in an 8-car race at the same SOF.

### Race Week Points

Your official score for a week is based on **the average of your best 25% of race results**, rounded up. That means you can run multiple times, but only the top finishes count:

| Number of Races in a Week | Number of Results Counted |
| :------------------------ | :------------------------ |
| 1–4 races                 | Best single result        |
| 5–8 races                 | Average of best 2 results |
| 9–12 races                | Average of best 3 results |
| 13–16 races               | Average of best 4 results |

So someone might run six races, but only their two best results feed the weekly total.

### Season Championship Points

Your Season Championship Points come from your **best eight** weekly scores out of the 12-week season, so a bad week (or a planned break) doesn’t kill your title hopes.

### Why Some Drivers Break 100+ Points

If you see someone with 120‑140 points after a single start, it usually means:

1. They raced in a high SOF split (3k+ average iRating).
2. They either ran multiple races and the 25% averaging kept only their monsters.
3. They might be in a higher division, but remember: division affects who you compete against, not the raw points you receive.

Your 80‑point win came from a 1.37k SOF, 10-car split – textbook solid result. To chase bigger numbers, you’d have to jump into stronger lobbies or keep stacking clean high finishes to boost your weekly average.

### Time Trial Championship

Separate from races: drivers run solo laps. First place gets 100 points, others scale down (e.g., 100/66/33 in a three-driver TT). Only your best eight TT weeks count toward the season title.

## Summary

1. **Single race points** scale with SOF and field size.
2. **Weekly points** average your top 25% finishes.
3. **Season standings** use your best eight weeks.
4. **Big numbers** come from high-SOF races and multiple strong attempts.

Understanding those levers lets you plan your attacks: pick the right time slots (higher SOF), run extra races to replace mediocre scores, and know when a safe banker finish is better than risking it all.
