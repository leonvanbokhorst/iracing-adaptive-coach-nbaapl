# Track Terminology Guide - Corner Types & Racing Lines

**A Practical Guide for the Ray FF1600 Driver**

Understanding what you're driving through helps you know HOW to drive it. Here's your reference for corner types, combinations, and track features.

## 🔄 Corner Types (By Radius & Speed)

### 1. **Hairpin**

**What it is:**
- Very tight, low-speed corner (usually 180° or close to it)
- Sharp radius, requires maximum rotation
- Usually 2nd gear in the Ray FF1600
- Entry: ~25-40 mph

**Characteristics:**
- Shortest radius of any corner type
- Hard braking required
- Requires quick rotation on entry
- Exit speed is KING (long straight usually follows)

**Technique:**
- Brake hard in straight line
- Long trail brake to late apex
- Rotate car early so you can unwind steering
- Smooth, progressive throttle (wheelspin = death)

**Examples:**
- Jefferson T3 (28-31 mph)
- Winton T2, T7 (34-37 mph)
- Rudskogen T5 (35-40 mph)

**Ray FF1600 Tip:** The open diff HATES harsh throttle out of hairpins. Wheelspin = understeer = slow exit.

---

### 2. **Carousel**

**What it is:**
- Long, constant-radius corner (90-180+ degrees)
- Medium speed, extended duration (3-5+ seconds)
- Usually 3rd gear in Ray FF1600
- Entry: ~45-65 mph

**Characteristics:**
- You're turning for a LONG time
- Constant/consistent radius (doesn't tighten or open much)
- Requires patience and consistent steering angle
- Can't rush it - have to "ride" it around

**Technique:**
- Early brake (earlier than you think!)
- Long, feathered trail brake deep into corner
- Late apex approach
- Maintain consistent steering angle (don't saw!)
- Feed throttle in gradually as you open steering

**Examples:**
- Jefferson T7 "Long Right Carousel" (47-53 mph)
- Rudskogen T11-T12 "Carousel Right" (55-62 mph)
- Winton T10 "Long Right Sweeper" (59-65 mph, carousel-like)

**Ray FF1600 Tip:** Patience wins. Adding more steering mid-carousel = understeer. Trust the initial rotation.

**Why called "Carousel":** Like a fairground merry-go-round, you're going in a circle for an extended time!

---

### 3. **Sweeper**

**What it is:**
- Fast, flowing corner with gentle radius
- High speed, minimal steering input
- Usually 4th gear (or high 3rd) in Ray FF1600
- Entry: ~70-95+ mph

**Characteristics:**
- Large radius, gentle arc
- Brief duration (1-2 seconds)
- Minimal braking (lift or light brush)
- Focus on smooth inputs and carrying speed

**Technique:**
- Small lift or light brake to settle car
- Minimal, smooth steering input
- Keep throttle as constant as possible
- Don't over-slow!

**Examples:**
- Jefferson T2 "Left Kink" (70-78 mph)
- Rudskogen T2 "Left Kink" (85-95 mph)
- Winton T1 "Right Sweeper" (65-71 mph)

**Ray FF1600 Tip:** The car has no aero, so it won't magically stick. Smooth hands = fast exit.

---

### 4. **90-Degree Turn** (Standard Corner)

**What it is:**
- Medium-radius, 90-degree corner
- Moderate speed reduction required
- Usually 2nd or 3rd gear
- Entry: ~35-60 mph

**Characteristics:**
- Classic "brake, turn, apex, exit" corner
- Not as tight as hairpin, not as long as carousel
- Quick rotation needed but not extreme

**Technique:**
- Standard trail braking approach
- Late apex preferred (unless setting up next corner)
- Progressive throttle on exit
- Focus on exit speed

**Examples:**
- Jefferson T1 "Right 90°" (37-40 mph)
- Rudskogen T1 (60-65 mph)
- Most "standard" corners on any track

**Ray FF1600 Tip:** Don't over-brake. The car carries momentum better than you think.

---

### 5. **Kink** (Fast Direction Change)

**What it is:**
- Very fast, slight direction change
- Minimal or no braking
- Usually flat-out or tiny lift
- Entry: ~80-110 mph

**Characteristics:**
- Small steering angle (< 20-30 degrees)
- Brief (under 1 second)
- More about car balance than technique
- Often on straights or between corners

**Technique:**
- Tiny lift (if needed) to settle car
- Minimal, precise steering
- Back to full throttle ASAP
- Keep hands calm

**Examples:**
- Jefferson T2 "Left Kink" (no brake, small lift)
- Jefferson T4 "Left Kink on Back Straight" (flat)
- Rudskogen T6 "Fast Right Kink" (flat)

**Ray FF1600 Tip:** If you're braking hard in a "kink," you're doing it wrong!

---

## 🔗 Corner Combinations

### 1. **Chicane**

**What it is:**
- Quick left-right (or right-left) combination
- Designed to slow cars on straights
- Usually linked with minimal straight between

**Characteristics:**
- First corner sets up second corner
- Often compromises both apexes
- Focus on exit of final corner

**Technique:**
- Brake once for the whole sequence
- Compromise first apex to set up second
- Roll speed through, don't stop and start
- Exit speed from last corner is priority

**Examples:**
- Not prominent on Jefferson/Rudskogen/Winton
- Common on F1 tracks (Monza chicanes, etc.)

**Ray FF1600 Tip:** Maintain flow. Two separate brake zones = you're over-slowing.

---

### 2. **Esses** (S-Curves)

**What it is:**
- Series of linked corners alternating direction
- Usually medium-to-fast speed
- Flow and rhythm critical

**Characteristics:**
- Each corner affects the next
- Compromise lines to maintain flow
- Consistent speed more important than peak speed
- Often 3-5 corners in sequence

**Technique:**
- Think of it as ONE long corner, not separate corners
- Light, brief braking inputs
- Rolling speed through > peak speed in one corner
- Keep steering smooth and progressive
- Exit of LAST corner is what matters

**Examples:**
- **Jefferson T5-T6 "Esses"** (Right then Left, 53-65 mph)
- **Rudskogen T3-T4 "Downhill Esses"** (Right then Left)
- **Winton T8-T9 "Esses"** (Left then Right, 65-75 mph)

**Ray FF1600 Tip:** Over-drive the first corner = struggle through rest of sequence. Patience!

---

### 3. **Switchback**

**What it is:**
- Tight corners in opposite directions
- Close together but distinct
- Often uphill/downhill

**Characteristics:**
- First corner is often slower
- Quick transition between them
- Position for second corner is critical

**Technique:**
- Sacrifice first corner to set up second
- Quick steering reversal
- Focus on exit of final corner

**Examples:**
- Winton T4 "Left Switchback" after T3
- Rudskogen has several in technical sections

---

### 4. **Double Apex**

**What it is:**
- Long corner with two distinct apex points
- One corner, but requires two inputs
- Often goes around obstacles or elevation

**Characteristics:**
- First apex is compromise
- Second apex is the "real" apex
- Long duration like carousel but with two peaks

**Technique:**
- Turn in for first apex
- Maintenance throttle between apexes
- Treat second apex as exit point
- Early throttle after second apex

**Examples:**
- Rudskogen T2 (Master Lonn's description: "3rd on first apex, 2nd before hill to second apex")
- Some carousel corners have double-apex characteristic

**Ray FF1600 Tip:** Don't rush the transition between apexes. Let the car settle.

## 🏁 Track Parts & Features

### **Apex**

**What it is:** The innermost point of your line through a corner (closest to inside edge).

**Types:**
- **Early Apex:** Turn in early, apex early → BAD (run wide on exit, no throttle room)
- **Late Apex:** Turn in later, apex 2/3+ into corner → GOOD (opens up exit, earlier throttle)
- **Diamond Apex:** Ultra-late apex, almost at exit → BEST for hairpins (maximum exit speed)

**Ray FF1600 Focus:** Late apex almost always wins. Exit speed > entry speed.

---

### **Racing Line**

**What it is:** The path through a corner that minimizes time (usually).

**Classic Racing Line:**
1. Enter wide
2. Turn in at specific point
3. Clip late apex
4. Exit wide (use all track)

**When to compromise:** Next corner is more important (like in esses).

---

### **Track Limits**

**What it is:** White lines at edge of track. Going beyond = penalty (off-track, 1x).

**Rules:**
- At least 2 wheels inside white line at all times
- Going beyond repeatedly = time penalty
- Curbs are usually "track" but check rules

---

### **Curbs (Kerbs)**

**What it is:** Raised, painted edges of corners.

**Types:**
- **Flat/Ripple Curbs:** Safe to use, can help rotation (entry) or open up corner (exit)
- **Sausage Curbs:** Tall, chunky curbs → AVOID in Ray FF1600! Will unsettle car badly.

**Ray FF1600 Tip:** Gentle brushing of flat curbs = good. Aggressive sausage curb = spin/damage.

---

### **Camber**

**What it is:** Banking or slope of the track surface.

**Types:**
- **Positive Camber:** Track slopes toward inside of corner → Helps grip!
- **Negative/Off-Camber:** Track slopes away from inside → Reduces grip, scary
- **Flat:** No camber

**Ray FF1600 Tip:** Positive camber = be brave. Off-camber = be gentle.

---

### **Elevation Change**

**What it is:** Uphill/downhill sections of track.

**Effects on Driving:**
- **Downhill Braking:** Car gets light, less braking grip (brake earlier/softer)
- **Uphill Braking:** Car compressed, MORE braking grip (can brake later/harder)
- **Crest (top of hill):** Car goes light, may lose grip
- **Compression (bottom of valley):** Car loads up, more grip available

**Examples:**
- **Rudskogen T2:** Downhill braking (tricky! brake at "50 sign" before crest)
- **Jefferson T3:** Slight downhill into hairpin

---

### **Braking Zones**

**What it is:** The section of track where you slow the car.

**Key Points:**
- **Brake Marker:** Reference point to start braking (100m board, sign, cone, etc.)
- **Straight-line Braking:** Initial hard brake before turning
- **Trail Braking:** Gradually release brake as you turn in (keeps weight on front)

**Ray FF1600 Tip:** Long, smooth trail brake = rotation. Stabbing brake = spin.

---

### **Overtaking Zones**

**Common overtaking corners:**
1. **End of longest straight** (into heavy braking zone)
2. **After key exit corner** (draft + better exit = pass next corner)
3. **Hairpins** (out-brake opponent, inside line)

**Defensive lines:**
- Cover inside early
- Brake slightly earlier
- Focus on exit, not apex defense

---

## 📊 Corner Priority System

Not all corners are equal! Focus on corners that matter:

### **Critical Corners** (Gain 0.2-0.5s per lap!)
1. **Last corner before longest straight** → Exit speed = lap time
2. **Hairpins onto straights** → Same reason
3. **Corner that sets up a sequence** → Get it wrong, whole sequence suffers

### **Medium Priority**
- Middle of lap corners
- Technical sequences (get them right for flow)

### **Low Priority**
- Corners that lead into more corners (compromise for next corner)
- Fast kinks (hard to gain time, easy to lose it)

**Focus 80% of practice on the critical corners!**

## 🎯 Quick Reference: Corner Type → Technique

| Corner Type | Speed | Gear | Technique Focus |
|-------------|-------|------|-----------------|
| **Hairpin** | Low (25-40) | 2nd | Rotation + early throttle |
| **90° Turn** | Medium (35-60) | 2nd-3rd | Late apex, exit speed |
| **Carousel** | Medium (45-65) | 3rd | Patience, consistent steering |
| **Sweeper** | High (70-95+) | 4th | Smooth inputs, carry speed |
| **Kink** | Very High (80-110) | 4th | Minimal input, confidence |
| **Esses** | Medium-High (50-75) | 3rd | Flow, rhythm, exit focus |

## 🏎️ Ray FF1600-Specific Corner Advice

### Low-Speed (Hairpins, tight 90s)
- **Challenge:** Open diff = wheelspin = understeer
- **Solution:** Smooth, progressive throttle application
- **Focus:** Rotate early, unwind steering, THEN throttle

### Medium-Speed (Carousels, standard corners)
- **Challenge:** No aero = car won't magically stick
- **Solution:** Trail braking for rotation, patient throttle
- **Focus:** Late apex, let car settle before full throttle

### High-Speed (Sweepers, kinks)
- **Challenge:** Car is light, minimal aero
- **Solution:** Smooth hands, small inputs, trust the grip
- **Focus:** Carry momentum, don't over-brake

## 📖 Master Lonn's Corner Lessons

**From Jefferson (Week 01):**
> "Time came from filling the gaps between brake and throttle (coasting dropped from 12% to 1.7%), not from braking later or carrying more corner speed. The transitions are where the time lives."

**From Rudskogen (Week 02):**
> "I can brake way later downhill just before the 50 sign and then trail brake all the way through the corner, getting into 3rd on the apex and into 2nd just before the bend to the hill to the second apex."

**The Pattern:**
1. Find specific reference marker
2. Master trail braking through entire corner
3. Lock in consistency
4. Performance follows

---

## 🏁 The Bottom Line

**Understanding corner types helps you:**
1. **Know what to expect** - "This is a carousel, I need patience"
2. **Apply right technique** - "Hairpin = early rotation, late throttle"
3. **Prioritize practice** - "This corner leads to longest straight = critical"
4. **Communicate clearly** - "I'm losing time in the esses" (everyone knows what you mean)

**The Ray FF1600 Golden Rule:**
> "Exit speed beats entry speed. Late apex beats early apex. Smooth beats aggressive."

Now you know WHY each corner type requires different technique!
