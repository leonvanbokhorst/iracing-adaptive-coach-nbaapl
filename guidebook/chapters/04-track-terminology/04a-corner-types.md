# Chapter 4a: Corner Types

**The 5 fundamental corners you'll encounter on every track**

---

## Overview

There are only 5 basic corner types in all of racing. Master these, and you can approach any track confidently.

- **Hairpin** 🔄 (Very tight, 180°)
- **Carousel** 🎠 (Long, constant radius)
- **Sweeper** 🌊 (Fast, flowing)
- **90-Degree Turn** 📐 (Standard corner)
- **Kink** ⚡ (Barely a corner)

---

## 1. Hairpin 🔄

**Definition:**
- Very tight, 180° (or close) corner
- Low speed, sharp radius
- Usually 2nd gear (Ray FF1600)
- Entry: ~25-40 mph

**Visual:**

```
   ────────→
           ╲
            ╲
             │ ← Apex (very late)
            ╱
           ╱
  ←────────
```

**Technique:**

1. **Brake hard** (straight line)
2. **Trail brake** to late apex
3. **Rotate early** so you can unwind steering
4. **Smooth throttle** (wheelspin kills exit speed)

**Why It Works:**

Hairpins are all about **exit speed**. You're going slow anyway, so entry speed doesn't matter. What matters is how early you can get on throttle and how hard you can accelerate out.

**Late apex** = earlier throttle = faster exit = faster down the next straight.

**Examples:**

- **Jefferson T3:** 28-31 mph hairpin
- **Winton T2, T7:** 34-37 mph hairpins
- **Rudskogen T5:** 35-40 mph hairpin

**Ray FF1600 Tip:**

The open diff HATES harsh throttle out of hairpins. Inside rear spins → understeer → slow exit.

**Solution:** Wait until the car is straighter (more steering unwound) before applying significant throttle.

**Master Lonn's Experience:**

Jefferson T3 (Week 01) - You learned to wait until the car was straighter before applying full throttle. That's hairpin mastery!

## 2. Carousel 🎠

**Definition:**
- Long, constant-radius corner (90-180+ degrees)
- Medium speed, extended duration (3-5+ seconds)
- Usually 3rd gear
- Entry: ~45-65 mph

**Visual:**

```
        ╭─────────────╮
       │               │
      │                 │
      │    Constant      │
      │    Radius        │
       │               │
        ╰─────────────╯
```

**Why Called "Carousel":**

Like a fairground merry-go-round—you're turning for a LONG time!

**Technique:**

1. **Early brake** (earlier than you think!)
2. **Long trail brake** deep into corner
3. **Late apex** approach
4. **Consistent steering angle** (don't saw!)
5. **Patient throttle** as you unwind

**Why It's Tricky:**

Carousels test **patience**. The corner lasts so long that you're tempted to add more steering mid-corner (because it feels like you're not turning enough). But adding steering = loading outside tires more = understeer.

**The secret:** Trust your initial rotation. Let the car settle into the arc.

**Examples:**

- **Jefferson T7:** Long Right Carousel (47-53 mph)
- **Rudskogen T11-T12:** Carousel Right (55-62 mph)
- **Winton T10:** Long Right Sweeper (carousel-like, 59-65 mph)

**Ray FF1600 Tip:**

Patience wins. Adding more steering mid-carousel = understeer. Trust the initial rotation.

**Master Lonn's Challenge (Week 03):**

Winton T10—you learned that carousels require commitment and patience. Can't rush them!

## 3. Sweeper 🌊

**Definition:**
- Fast, flowing corner with gentle radius
- High speed, minimal steering input
- Usually 4th gear (or high 3rd)
- Entry: ~70-95+ mph

**Visual:**

```
────────╲
         ╲   ← Brief, smooth arc
          ╲
           ──────────
```

**Technique:**

1. **Small lift** or light brake (settle car)
2. **Minimal steering** input
3. **Constant throttle** as much as possible
4. **Don't over-slow!** (common mistake)

**Why It Works:**

Sweepers are about **momentum**. You're carrying high speed through a gentle arc. The less you disturb the car (sudden inputs), the faster you'll be.

**Common mistake:** Braking too much. The corner is faster than you think!

**Examples:**

- **Jefferson T2:** Left Kink/Sweeper (70-78 mph)
- **Rudskogen T2:** Left Kink (85-95 mph)
- **Winton T1:** Right Sweeper (65-71 mph)

**Ray FF1600 Tip:**

The car has NO aero, so it won't magically stick. Smooth hands = fast exit.

**Master Lonn's Application:**

You've learned that sweepers feel faster than they are. Trust the car's grip and commit!

## 4. 90-Degree Turn (Standard Corner) 📐

**Definition:**
- Medium-radius, 90-degree corner
- Moderate speed reduction required
- Usually 2nd or 3rd gear
- Entry: ~35-60 mph

**Visual:**

```
────────→
        │
        │ ← Classic 90°
        ↓
```

**Technique:**

1. **Standard trail braking** approach
2. **Late apex** preferred (unless setting up next corner)
3. **Progressive throttle** on exit
4. **Focus on exit speed**

**Why It's Important:**

90-degree corners are the "default" corner. They're everywhere. Master these, and you've mastered most corners on most tracks.

**The technique:** Exactly what you've been practicing—brake hard in a straight line, trail brake to late apex, progressive throttle on exit.

**Examples:**

- **Jefferson T1:** Right 90° (37-40 mph)
- **Rudskogen T1:** 60-65 mph
- Most "standard" corners on any track

**Ray FF1600 Tip:**

Don't over-brake. The car carries momentum better than you think.

**Master Lonn's Foundation:**

This is the corner type you've practiced most. All the trail braking, late apex, progressive throttle lessons apply here.

## 5. Kink (Fast Direction Change) ⚡

**Definition:**
- Very fast, slight direction change
- Minimal or no braking
- Usually flat-out or tiny lift
- Entry: ~80-110 mph

**Visual:**

```
────────╲─────────  ← Barely a corner!
```

**Technique:**

1. **Tiny lift** (if needed) to settle car
2. **Minimal, precise steering**
3. **Back to full throttle ASAP**
4. **Keep hands calm**

**Why It's Different:**

Kinks aren't really "corners" in the traditional sense. They're high-speed direction changes where you're trying to disturb the car as little as possible.

**The key:** Smoothness. Jerky steering at 90+ mph = big problem.

**Examples:**

- **Jefferson T2:** Left Kink (no brake, small lift)
- **Jefferson T4:** Left Kink on Back Straight (flat)
- **Rudskogen T6:** Fast Right Kink (flat)

**Ray FF1600 Tip:**

If you're braking HARD in a "kink," you're doing it wrong! It should be flat-out or a tiny lift at most.

**Master Lonn's Realization:**

Kinks feel scarier than they are. The FF1600 has enough grip to take them flat if you're smooth.

## How to Identify Corner Type

**When approaching a new corner, ask:**

1. **How tight is the radius?**
   - Very tight → Hairpin
   - Medium → 90-degree
   - Gentle → Sweeper
   - Barely turning → Kink

2. **How long does it last?**
   - 3-5+ seconds → Carousel
   - 1-2 seconds → 90-degree or Sweeper
   - < 1 second → Kink

3. **What gear am I in?**
   - 2nd → Hairpin or tight 90°
   - 3rd → Carousel or medium 90°
   - 4th → Sweeper
   - 4th-5th flat → Kink
