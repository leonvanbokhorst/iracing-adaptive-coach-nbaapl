# Chapter 4b: Corner Combinations

**When corners link together: flow, rhythm, and compromise**

---

## Overview

Individual corners are one thing. But tracks don't give you isolated corners—they give you **sequences**.

Learning to treat corner combinations as a single unit (not separate corners) is the key to fast lap times.

This chapter covers the 4 main corner combinations:
- **Chicane** 🪃
- **Esses (S-Curves)** 〰️
- **Switchback** ⤴️
- **Double Apex** 🎯🎯

---

## 1. Chicane 🪃

**Definition:**
- Quick left-right (or right-left) combination
- Designed to slow cars on straights
- Minimal straight between corners

**Visual:**

```
────────→╲    ╱←──────
          ╲  ╱
           ╲╱
```

**Purpose:**

Chicanes are artificial. Track designers add them to break up long straights (for safety) or to increase technical difficulty.

**Technique:**

1. **Brake once** for the whole sequence
2. **Compromise the first apex** to set up the second
3. **Roll speed through** (don't stop and start)
4. **Exit speed from the last corner** is priority

**Why This Works:**

If you treat a chicane as two separate corners, you'll brake twice—once for each corner. That kills momentum and wastes time.

Instead: **One brake zone, flowing through both corners, optimize the exit.**

**The Compromise:**

- First corner: Slightly wider/earlier apex than ideal
- Second corner: Perfect apex for maximum exit speed

**Ray FF1600 Tip:**

Maintain flow. Two separate brake zones = you're over-slowing.

**Examples:**

- **Jefferson T1-T2:** Some tracks have chicanes (not Jefferson specifically, but common)
- **Winton T1-T2:** Could be treated as chicane-like (sweeper into hairpin)

**Master Lonn's Learning:**

You've discovered that flowing through sequences > stopping and starting. That's the chicane principle.

## 2. Esses (S-Curves) 〰️

**Definition:**
- Series of linked corners alternating direction
- Usually medium-to-fast speed
- Flow and rhythm critical

**Visual:**

```
      ╱──╲
    ╱      ╲──╲
  ╱            ╲
```

**Technique:**

1. **Think of it as ONE long corner** (not separate)
2. **Light, brief braking** inputs (if any)
3. **Rolling speed through** > peak speed in one corner
4. **Exit of the LAST corner** is what matters

**Why It's Tricky:**

Your brain wants to treat each direction change as a separate corner. But that approach ruins flow.

**The secret:** Rhythm. Like a dance—left, right, left, right—smooth transitions, constant speed.

**Compromise Principle:**

- **First corners:** Sacrifice apex placement for flow
- **Middle corners:** Maintain rhythm
- **Last corner:** Perfect apex for maximum exit

**Examples:**

- **Jefferson T5-T6:** Right then Left (53-65 mph)
- **Rudskogen T3-T4:** Downhill Esses
- **Winton T8-T9:** Left then Right (65-75 mph)

**Ray FF1600 Tip:**

Over-drive the first corner = struggle through rest of sequence. Patience!

**Master Lonn's Application:**

Jefferson T5-T6—you learned to treat them as one flowing section, not two separate corners. That's esses mastery!

## 3. Switchback ⤴️

**Definition:**
- Tight corners in opposite directions
- Close together but distinct
- Often uphill/downhill
- Sharper transitions than esses

**Visual:**

```
────→╲
      ╲
       │  ← First corner (sacrifice this)
        ╲
         ╲
          ╰──→  ← Second corner (optimize this)
```

**Technique:**

1. **Sacrifice the first corner** to set up the second
2. **Quick steering reversal** between corners
3. **Focus on exit** of the final corner
4. **Weight transfer management** critical

**Why It's Different from Esses:**

Esses are flowing. Switchbacks are **abrupt**. You're making sharp direction changes, not gentle curves.

**The Challenge:**

Weight transfer happens fast. Car loads outside tires in first corner, then immediately loads opposite side in second corner. The car never settles.

**Solution:** Smooth inputs, progressive steering reversal, patience on throttle.

**Examples:**

- **Winton T4:** Left Switchback after T3
- **Rudskogen:** Several in technical sections

**Ray FF1600 Tip:**

Don't fight the car. Let it transfer weight naturally between corners.

**Master Lonn's Challenge:**

Switchbacks feel chaotic. They are. Embrace the chaos, focus on the exit.

## 4. Double Apex 🎯🎯

**Definition:**
- Long corner with TWO distinct apex points
- One corner, but requires two inputs
- Often goes around obstacles or elevation

**Visual:**

```
       ╭───①───╮
      │         │
     │    ②     │  ← Two apex points
      │         │
       ╰────────╯
```

**Technique:**

1. **Turn in for the first apex**
2. **Maintenance throttle** between apexes
3. **Treat the second apex** as the actual exit point
4. **Early throttle** after the second apex

**Why Two Apexes?**

Sometimes a corner is so long that it feels like two corners in one. Or there's an obstacle (elevation, camber change) that creates a natural "break" in the turn.

**The Approach:**

- **First apex:** Light touch, just kiss the inside
- **Between apexes:** Maintenance throttle, wait for the car to settle
- **Second apex:** The REAL apex—this one matters for exit speed

**Examples:**

- **Rudskogen T2:** Master Lonn's description: "3rd on first apex, 2nd before hill to second apex"
- Some carousel corners have double-apex characteristic
- **Winton T10:** Can be treated as double-apex (long sweeper with two distinct phases)

**Ray FF1600 Tip:**

Don't rush the transition between apexes. Let the car settle.

**Master Lonn's Experience:**

Rudskogen T2 taught you about double apex—gear change between apexes, patience through the sequence.

## Corner Combination Principles

### Universal Rules

**1. Treat sequences as ONE corner**
- Don't brake multiple times
- Flow > peak speed in any single element
- Optimize the LAST corner's exit

**2. Compromise early, perfect late**
- First corner: Good enough to set up the next
- Middle corners: Maintain rhythm
- Last corner: Maximum exit speed

**3. Weight transfer is critical**
- Quick direction changes = rapid weight shifts
- Smooth inputs prevent oscillations
- Let the car settle between changes

**4. The exit always wins**
- If in doubt, sacrifice entry for exit
- The last corner's exit determines your straight-line speed
- Exit speed compounds (carries forward)

## Combination Summary Table

| Type | Speed | Key Principle | Common Mistake |
|:-----|:------|:--------------|:---------------|
| **Chicane** 🪃 | Slow-Med | One brake, flow through | Braking twice |
| **Esses** 〰️ | Med-Fast | Rhythm, rolling speed | Treating as separate |
| **Switchback** ⤴️ | Slow-Med | Sacrifice first, exit second | Fighting weight transfer |
| **Double Apex** 🎯🎯 | Med-Fast | Maintenance throttle between | Rushing transition |
