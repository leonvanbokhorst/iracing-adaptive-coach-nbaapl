# Chapter 4c: Track Features

**The components that make up every track**

---

## Overview

Tracks aren't just a series of corners. They're made up of specific features—apex points, elevation changes, camber, curbs—that affect how you drive.

Understanding these features helps you:
- Set up proper reference points
- Anticipate grip changes
- Communicate with coaches/other drivers

This chapter covers:
- Apex (types and when to use each)
- Racing Line
- Track Limits
- Curbs (flat vs. sausage)
- Camber (banking)
- Elevation Changes
- Braking Zones

---

## Apex 🎯

**Definition:** The innermost point of your line through a corner (closest to inside edge).

### The Three Types

**1. Early Apex** ❌

**What it is:**
- Turn in early, apex early in the corner (1/3 of the way through)

**Result:**
- Run wide on exit
- No room for throttle
- Slow exit speed

**When to use:**
- Almost never
- Exception: When setting up a switchback or sacrificing for next corner

**Visual:**
```
Enter →  ╲
          ●  ← Early apex (1/3 into corner)
           ╲ ← Forced wide on exit
            ╲ ← Can't add throttle
```

---

**2. Late Apex** ✅

**What it is:**
- Turn in later, apex 2/3+ into the corner

**Result:**
- Opens up the exit
- Earlier throttle application
- Faster exit speed

**When to use:**
- Almost always (this is your default)
- Especially on corners leading to straights

**Visual:**
```
Enter → ╲
         ╲
          ╲
           ● ← Late apex (2/3 into corner)
          ╱ ← Wide exit, room for throttle
```

**Why it wins:** **Exit speed > Entry speed.** You sacrifice a bit of entry speed to maximize exit speed.

---

**3. Diamond Apex** ✅✅

**What it is:**
- Ultra-late apex, almost at the exit of the corner
- Even later than "late apex"

**Result:**
- Maximum exit speed
- Earliest possible throttle
- Car is almost straight when you add power

**When to use:**
- Hairpins (always)
- Corners leading to long straights
- When exit speed is CRITICAL

**Visual:**
```
Enter → ╲
         ╲
          ╲
           ╲
            ● ← Diamond apex (90%+ into corner)
           ╱ ← Maximum exit room
```

**Ray FF1600 Focus:**

Late apex almost always wins. **Exit speed > Entry speed.**

**Master Lonn's Breakthrough (Week 03, Winton T5):**

You discovered the wide arc = later apex = more speed. That's the late apex principle in action!

---

## Racing Line 🏁

**Definition:** The path through a corner that minimizes lap time.

**The Classic Racing Line:**

```
1. Enter WIDE ──────────────→
2. Turn in at specific point   ╲
3. Clip LATE apex               ●
4. Exit WIDE (use all track)   ╱
                         ←─────
```

**The Geometry:**

- **Wide entry** = Shallower turn-in angle = Less steering needed
- **Late apex** = Earlier throttle = Faster exit
- **Wide exit** = Maximum radius = Highest speed

**When to Compromise the Racing Line:**

- When the next corner is more important (esses, combinations)
- When defending position (Chapter 13)
- When setting up an overtake (Chapter 13)

**Master Lonn's Philosophy (Week 03):**

"Wide arc, 2/3 of track width" = racing line principle applied perfectly.

---

## Track Limits 🚧

**Definition:** White lines at the edge of the track.

**The Official Rules:**

- At least **2 wheels inside** the white line at all times
- Going beyond = penalty (off-track, 1×)
- Repeated violations = time penalty or disqualification

**Curbs (Kerbs):**

Usually considered part of the track, but **check the specific track rules**!

**Why It Matters:**

- Gaining advantage by exceeding limits = penalty
- Consistent track limit violations = black flag
- In qualifying, lap time can be invalidated

**Master Lonn's Learning:**

Pushing track limits is part of maximizing speed, but going beyond = wasted lap.

---

## Curbs (Kerbs) 🟥⬜🟥

**Definition:** Raised, painted edges of corners (usually red/white striped).

### Types

**1. Flat/Ripple Curbs** ✅

**What they are:**
- Low-profile, rippled surface
- Usually red/white striped

**Safe to use:**
- Entry curbs: Can help rotation (brief weight transfer)
- Exit curbs: Can open up the corner (use more track)
- Apex curbs: Can shorten the corner slightly

**Technique:**
- **Brush** the curb (light touch)
- Don't **ride** the curb (prolonged contact)

---

**2. Sausage Curbs** ❌

**What they are:**
- Tall, chunky, cylindrical curbs
- Often bright colored
- Designed to DETER cutting

**AVOID in Ray FF1600!**
- Will unsettle the car badly
- Can cause loss of control
- Can damage suspension

**Why they exist:** To prevent corner cutting (track limits enforcement).

**Rule:** If you see sausage curbs, stay away!

---

**Ray FF1600 Curb Strategy:**

- Gentle brushing of flat curbs = good
- Aggressive sausage curb = spin/damage
- When in doubt, stay on tarmac

---

## Camber 📐

**Definition:** Banking or slope of the track surface.

### Types

**Positive Camber (Banked)** ✅

**What it is:**
- Track slopes TOWARD the inside of the corner
- Like a NASCAR oval

**Effect:**
- **Helps grip!** (gravity works with you)
- Car feels more stable
- Can carry more speed

**Approach:**
- Be brave
- Carry more speed than flat corner
- Trust the banking

---

**Negative/Off-Camber** ⚠️

**What it is:**
- Track slopes AWAY from the inside
- Gravity pulls you toward the outside

**Effect:**
- **Reduces grip** (gravity works against you)
- Car feels unstable
- Requires caution

**Approach:**
- Be gentle
- Less speed than you'd expect
- Smooth inputs critical

---

**Flat Camber**

**What it is:**
- No slope, level track

**Effect:**
- Standard grip
- Predictable behavior

---

**Ray FF1600 Tip:**

Positive camber = be brave. Off-camber = be gentle.

**Master Lonn's Experience:**

You've felt the difference—banked corners feel more secure, off-camber feels sketchy. That's camber at work!

---

## Elevation Change ⛰️

**Definition:** Uphill/downhill sections of track.

### Effects on Driving

**Downhill Braking** ⬇️

**What happens:**
- Car gets light (weight shifts forward)
- Less braking grip available
- Rear wheels unload (can lock easily)

**Solution:**
- Brake **earlier**
- Brake **softer**
- Be gentle on pedal inputs

---

**Uphill Braking** ⬆️

**What happens:**
- Car compressed (weight shifts rearward)
- MORE braking grip available
- Front wheels plant

**Solution:**
- Can brake **later**
- Can brake **harder**
- Take advantage of extra grip

---

**Crest (Top of Hill)** 🔝

**What happens:**
- Car goes light (vertical load reduces)
- May lose grip momentarily
- Suspension unloads

**Danger:**
- If turning while cresting = possible loss of grip
- If braking while cresting = possible lockup

**Solution:**
- Finish braking before crest
- Gentle inputs over the top
- Anticipate weight shift

---

**Compression (Bottom of Valley)** ⬇️⬆️

**What happens:**
- Car loads up (vertical load increases)
- More grip available
- Suspension compresses

**Opportunity:**
- Can carry more speed
- Can brake later
- Can turn harder

**Solution:**
- Use the extra grip
- Be aggressive (but smooth)

---

**Examples:**

- **Rudskogen T2:** Downhill braking (tricky! Brake at "50 sign" before crest)
- **Jefferson T3:** Slight downhill into hairpin

**Master Lonn's Challenge (Week 02, Rudskogen T2):**

You discovered downhill braking is scary—the car feels light and wants to lock up. That's elevation at work!

---

## Braking Zones 🛑

**Definition:** The section of track where you slow the car.

### Key Concepts

**Braking Marker** 🎯

**What it is:**
- Visual reference for where to brake
- Can be natural or artificial

**Examples:**
- "100m board" (distance marker)
- "3 board" (turn marker)
- Shadow of a tree
- Specific curb section
- Crack in pavement

**Why it matters:** Consistency. Same marker = same brake point = consistent lap times.

---

**Braking Point** 📍

**What it is:**
- The exact location where you hit the brakes
- Should be repeatable lap after lap

**How to find it:**
1. Pick a marker
2. Try braking there
3. Adjust forward/back based on result
4. Lock in when consistent

**Master Lonn's Progression:**

- **Week 01:** Braking by feel (inconsistent)
- **Week 02:** Using markers ("50 sign" at Rudskogen T2)
- **Week 03:** Consistent braking points = consistent lap times ✅

---

**Turn-In Point** 🔄

**What it is:**
- Where you begin steering into the corner
- Usually after initial heavy braking
- Before the apex

**Relationship:**
```
Brake Point → Heavy braking → Turn-In Point → Trail brake → Apex → Exit
```

**Why it matters:** Late turn-in = late apex = good exit. Early turn-in = early apex = bad exit.

---

## Key Takeaways

✅ **Late apex wins** almost always (exit speed > entry speed)

✅ **Diamond apex** for hairpins and corners before straights

✅ **Racing line** = Wide entry, late apex, wide exit

✅ **Track limits** = 2 wheels inside white line

✅ **Flat curbs** = safe to brush, **sausage curbs** = avoid!

✅ **Positive camber** = more grip (be brave)

✅ **Negative camber** = less grip (be gentle)

✅ **Elevation affects braking:**
- Downhill = brake earlier/softer
- Uphill = brake later/harder
- Crest = danger zone (car goes light)
- Compression = opportunity (more grip)

✅ **Braking markers** = consistency tool (same marker = same lap time)
