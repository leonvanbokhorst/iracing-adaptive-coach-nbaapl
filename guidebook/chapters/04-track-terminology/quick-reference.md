# Chapter 4: Track Terminology - Quick Reference ⚡

**Complete racing vocabulary at a glance**

## Corner Types (The 5 Fundamentals)

**Hairpin 🔄:** Very tight, 180°, ~30-40 mph, 2nd gear, late apex wins

**Carousel 🎠:** Long constant-radius turn, 90-180°+, ~45-65 mph, 3rd gear, patience required

**Sweeper 🌊:** Fast flowing corner, minimal steering, ~70-95+ mph, 4th gear, don't over-slow

**90-Degree 📐:** Standard medium corner, ~35-60 mph, 2nd-3rd gear, trail brake to late apex

**Kink ⚡:** Barely a corner, tiny lift or flat, ~80-110+ mph, minimal steering

---

## Corner Combinations

**Chicane 🪃:** Quick left-right (or right-left), brake once for whole sequence, compromise first apex

**Esses 〰️:** Linked S-curves alternating direction, treat as ONE long corner, flow > speed

**Switchback ⤴️:** Tight corners in opposite directions, sacrifice first to set up second

**Double Apex 🎯🎯:** One long corner with TWO apex points, maintenance throttle between

## Track Features

### Apex Types
- **Early apex** ❌ = Run wide on exit, no throttle room
- **Late apex** ✅ = Opens exit, earlier throttle (default choice)
- **Diamond apex** ✅✅ = Ultra-late, maximum exit speed (hairpins, before straights)

### Racing Line
```
Enter WIDE → Turn in → LATE apex → Exit WIDE
```

### Track Limits
- 2 wheels inside white line = legal
- Beyond white line = penalty (off-track, 1×)

### Curbs
- **Flat/ripple curbs** ✅ = Safe to use
- **Sausage curbs** ❌ = AVOID in FF1600 (will upset car)

### Camber
- **Positive (banked in)** ✅ = More grip, be brave
- **Negative (off-camber)** ⚠️ = Less grip, be gentle
- **Flat** = Standard grip

### Elevation
- **Downhill braking** ⬇️ = Car gets light, brake earlier/softer
- **Uphill braking** ⬆️ = Car compressed, brake later/harder
- **Crest (hill top)** 🔝 = Car goes light, danger zone
- **Compression (valley)** ⬇️⬆️ = Car loads up, more grip

### Braking Zones
- **Braking marker** 🎯 = Visual reference ("100m board," "3 board")
- **Braking point** 📍 = Exact location to hit brakes
- **Turn-in point** 🔄 = Where you begin steering

## Racing Concepts

### Line Types
- **Optimal/Fastest:** Late apex, maximum time
- **Defensive:** Inside line, protect position
- **Overtaking:** Different from optimal, sets up pass

### Sectors
- Track divided into 2-3 timed sections
- Identify where you're fast/slow
- Focus practice on weak sectors

### Optimal vs. PB
- **PB (Personal Best):** Your fastest single lap
- **Theoretical Optimal:** Best S1 + Best S2 + Best S3
- **Gap** = Potential improvement available

```
Example:
- Optimal: 1:29.031
- PB: 1:29.691
- Gap: 0.660s ← You can find this!
```

### Consistency (σ - Sigma)
Standard deviation of lap times

- **σ = 0.3s** = Very consistent ✅
- **σ = 1.0s** = Inconsistent ⚠️
- **σ = 2.0s+** = All over the place ❌

**FF1600 Targets:**
- Beginner: σ < 1.0s
- Intermediate: σ < 0.5s
- Advanced: σ < 0.3s

### Strength of Field (SOF)
Average iRating of everyone in your split

- **1000-1500:** Rookie/learning
- **1500-2500:** Competitive
- **2500-4000:** Top splits
- **4000+:** Alien territory

## Quick Corner Type Identifier

**Ask yourself:**

- Very tight, 180°? → **Hairpin** 🔄
- Long, constant radius, 3-5+ seconds? → **Carousel** 🎠
- Fast, minimal steering, 70+ mph? → **Sweeper** 🌊
- Standard 90°, medium speed? → **90-Degree** 📐
- Barely turning, 80+ mph? → **Kink** ⚡

---

## Key Takeaways

✅ **Late apex wins** almost always (exit speed > entry speed)

✅ **5 corner types** cover 95% of all corners

✅ **Elevation affects braking** (downhill = gentle, uphill = hard)

✅ **Camber affects grip** (positive = more, negative = less)

✅ **Consistency (σ) matters** as much as raw speed

✅ **Optimal - PB = Gap** (your potential improvement)

---

## The Golden Rule

**"Exit speed > Entry speed"**

That's why late apex wins. You sacrifice entry to maximize exit.
