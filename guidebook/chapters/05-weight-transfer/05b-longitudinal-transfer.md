# Chapter 5b: Longitudinal Weight Transfer

**Braking & acceleration: How weight shifts front ⬄ rear**

---

## Overview

**Longitudinal weight transfer** occurs during braking and acceleration, shifting load between the front and rear axles.

This is the most intuitive type of weight transfer—you feel it every time you brake (pushed forward) or accelerate (pushed back).

---

## Braking (Forward Weight Transfer)

When you brake:

1. **Deceleration force** pushes the CoG forward
2. **Front suspension compresses** (nose dives)
3. **Rear suspension extends** (tail lifts)
4. **Load shifts from rear tires to front tires**

**Effects:**

- ✅ **Front grip increases** (more load = more grip)
- ✅ **Front tires work harder** (can brake later)
- ❌ **Rear grip decreases** (less load = less grip)
- ❌ **Rear tires unload** (can lock up easily)

### The FF1600 Under Braking

With ~45/55 weight distribution, the rear is already light. Heavy braking makes it **very light**.

**Why this matters:**

- **Rear brake bias too high** = instant lockup and spin
- **Too much brake + downshift** = rear instability
- **Sudden brake release** = sudden weight shift back, unsettling the car

**Golden Rule:** Brake hard initially (load the front), then **trail off progressively** to keep the platform stable.

## Acceleration (Rearward Weight Transfer)

When you accelerate:

1. **Acceleration force** pushes the CoG rearward
2. **Rear suspension compresses** (squats)
3. **Front suspension extends** (nose lifts)
4. **Load shifts from front tires to rear tires**

**Effects:**

- ✅ **Rear grip increases** (more traction)
- ✅ **Rear tires plant** (can put power down)
- ❌ **Front grip decreases** (less load on front tires)
- ❌ **Front can wash out** if steering input is too high

### The FF1600 Under Acceleration

With only 116 hp, you might think power isn't an issue. **Wrong.**

The open differential means:

- **Inside rear wheel unloads in corners** (gets light)
- **Power goes to the unloaded wheel** (the one with least resistance)
- **Wheelspin on inside = loss of forward drive**

**Golden Rule:** Apply throttle **progressively** to keep load balanced across both rear tires.

**Master Lonn's Application (Week 03, Winton T5):**

Early throttle + tight line = inside wheel spin = understeer.

Solution: Later throttle + wider line = both rear wheels loaded = FAST exit! 🚀

## Engine Braking vs. Brake Pedal

There are **two ways to slow the car**, each with different weight transfer characteristics:

### Brake Pedal Method

**What it is:** Using the brake pedal to create friction at the wheels (brake pads clamping rotors).

**Weight transfer characteristic:**

- **Sudden, sharp forward weight transfer**
- Front suspension compresses quickly
- Rear unloads rapidly
- Maximum stopping power available

**When to use:**

- Heavy braking zones (need maximum deceleration)
- Slow corners requiring significant speed scrub
- Emergency situations

**Feel:** Sharp nose dive, harness tension, immediate weight shift

### Engine Braking Method

**What it is:** Using drivetrain resistance to slow the car (downshift while lifting throttle, minimal or no brake pedal).

**Weight transfer characteristic:**

- **Gradual, progressive forward weight transfer**
- Weight shifts forward smoothly through drivetrain
- Car stays more balanced and settled
- Less maximum stopping power, but more control

**When to use:**

- Momentum corners (want to maintain flow and balance)
- When you need to rotate the car naturally
- Technical sections where platform stability matters
- Combination with light brake pedal for fine control

**Feel:** Smooth deceleration, car stays settled, progressive weight shift

### The Key Difference

**It's not about WHERE the force is applied** (both slow the car). It's about **HOW GRADUALLY** the weight transfers:

- **Brake pedal:** Like hitting a wall → sudden weight shift → can upset balance
- **Engine braking:** Like rolling resistance → smooth weight shift → maintains platform stability

**Master Lonn's Discovery (Week 03, Winton T5-T6):**

VRS coach uses engine braking (downshift, no brake) → maintains momentum, tighter line, faster.

Your approach (brake pedal) → scrubs 14 km/h, wider line needed, slower.

**The lesson:** Engine braking = momentum management tool. Brake pedal = speed scrubbing tool.

## Key Takeaways

✅ **Braking = forward transfer** (front gains grip, rear loses grip)

✅ **Acceleration = rearward transfer** (rear gains traction, front loses grip)

✅ **FF1600 rear is already light** (45/55 static → ~70/30 under braking)

✅ **Open diff kills inside rear** (early throttle = wheelspin, no drive)

✅ **Brake pedal vs. engine braking** (sudden vs. gradual weight shift)

✅ **Progressive inputs are key** (smooth brake release, smooth throttle)
