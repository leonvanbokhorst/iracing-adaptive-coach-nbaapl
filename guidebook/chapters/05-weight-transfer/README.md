# Chapter 5: Weight Transfer - The Unseen Force

**Welcome to the Weight Transfer module!**

Weight transfer is THE fundamental skill in the Ray FF1600. With no downforce and only 504 kg, every input you make redistributes load across four tiny contact patches.

This chapter has been split into focused micro-chapters for ADHD-friendly learning. Each section is a standalone study session.

## 🎓 Learning Path

**For Complete Beginners:**
1. Read [Quick Reference](quick-reference.md) (overview)
2. Study [05a: Physics & Fundamentals](05a-physics-fundamentals.md) (foundation)
3. Study [05b: Longitudinal Transfer](05b-longitudinal-transfer.md) (braking/accel)
4. Study [05c: Lateral & Combined](05c-lateral-combined.md) (trail braking)
5. Study [05d: Feeling & Reading](05d-feeling-reading.md) (feedback)
6. Study [05e: Techniques & Practice](05e-techniques-practice.md) (application)

**For Track Day:**
- Read [Quick Reference](quick-reference.md) only (60 seconds)
- Focus on: Progressive brake release, smooth throttle, traction circle
- Remember: Smooth inputs = smooth weight transfer = fast laps

**For Specific Problems:**
- Locking up on braking? → [05b: Longitudinal Transfer](05b-longitudinal-transfer.md)
- Understeering mid-corner? → [05c: Lateral & Combined](05c-lateral-combined.md)
- Can't feel what car is doing? → [05d: Feeling & Reading](05d-feeling-reading.md)
- Need practice drills? → [05e: Techniques & Practice](05e-techniques-practice.md)
