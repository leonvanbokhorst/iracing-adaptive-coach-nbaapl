# Chapter 5: Weight Transfer - Quick Reference ⚡

**60-second track day cheat sheet**

---

## Core Principle

The car's **total weight doesn't change** (504 kg), but **load on each tire** changes constantly based on your inputs. Weight transfer is THE primary tool for grip management in the FF1600.

---

## Three Types of Transfer

### Longitudinal (Front ⬄ Rear)
- **Braking:** Weight shifts forward → front grip ↑, rear grip ↓
- **Acceleration:** Weight shifts rearward → rear grip ↑, front grip ↓

### Lateral (Inside ⬄ Outside)
- **Cornering:** Weight shifts to outside tires → outside grip ↑, inside tires unload

### Combined (The Hard One)
- **Trail braking:** Braking + turning = outside front tire is hero, inside rear is passenger

---

## The Traction Circle

Each tire has a grip limit (the circle). Forces combine using **vector math**:

```
Total Force = √(Braking² + Cornering²)
```

**Examples:**
- 70.7% braking + 70.7% cornering = 100% (at the limit)
- 100% braking + 50% cornering = 112% → **tire slides!**

**Key insight:** You can do more of both than you'd think (stay on the circle).

---

## FF1600-Specific

- **No downforce** → 100% mechanical grip (weight transfer is your ONLY tool)
- **504 kg** → Small inputs = big load changes
- **Open diff** → Inside rear wheel useless on throttle (power goes to unloaded wheel)
- **Mid-engine** → 45/55 weight distribution (rear light under braking)

---

## Golden Techniques

### Progressive Brake Release (Trail Braking)
1. **Heavy brake (straight):** 100% pressure, load the front
2. **Turn-in (20-50% brake):** Maintain some brake, start steering
3. **Apex (0-10% brake):** Finish brake release, add throttle
4. **Exit (progressive throttle):** Load rear, drive out

**Feel:** Smooth transition, not on/off.

### Smooth Throttle Application
- **Apex:** 0% throttle (max steering)
- **Begin exit:** 20% throttle (start loading rear)
- **Track out:** 50-80% throttle (progressively)
- **Straight:** 100% throttle (car straight)

**Feel:** Squeeze, don't punch.

### Steering Discipline
- **One smooth input** per corner (turn-in → hold → unwind)
- **No sawing** (if correcting mid-corner = wrong entry speed/line)

## Common Mistakes Checklist

- ❌ **Abrupt brake release** → Front unloads, understeer
- ❌ **Too early throttle** → Front unloads, understeer OR inside rear spins
- ❌ **Sudden steering inputs** → Outside tires overloaded, slide
- ❌ **Ignoring inside rear** → Early throttle = wheelspin, no drive
- ❌ **Fighting the car** → Constant corrections = weight oscillations = slow

---

## How to Feel It

- **Steering weight:** Heavy = front loaded (gripping), Light = front unloaded (less grip)
- **Brake pedal:** Firm = good transfer, Sudden lockup = tire unloaded
- **Throttle response:** Smooth accel = rear loaded, Wheelspin = rear unloaded
- **G-forces:** Forward (braking), Back (accel), Sideways (cornering)
- **Car behavior:** Nose dives (braking), Nose lifts (accel), Body rolls (cornering)

---

## How to See It (Telemetry)

- **Brake + Steering overlap** = Trail braking (combined transfer)
- **Lateral G** = Cornering load (smooth curve = good, spiky = fighting)
- **Longitudinal G** = Braking/accel (smooth transition = good)
- **Speed trace** = Higher minimum corner speed = better weight management

---

## Practice Drills Quick List

1. **Brake Release Challenge:** Compare abrupt vs. progressive release
2. **Throttle Timing Test:** Find optimal throttle application point
3. **Steering Discipline:** Eliminate mid-corner corrections
4. **Weight Transfer Visualization:** Mentally visualize load moving
5. **Telemetry Study:** Identify smooth vs. abrupt transitions in data

---

## Key Takeaway

**Smooth inputs = smooth weight transfer = fast laps**

The car tells you where the weight is through steering feel, pedal response, and g-forces. Listen to it.
