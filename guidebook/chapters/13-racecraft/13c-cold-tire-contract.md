# Chapter 13c: The Cold Tire Contract

**Lap 1-3 race start protocol for survival and success**

---

## The Principle

**Master Lonn's Framework Extended:**

The Cold Tire Contract is a race-start protocol that prioritizes survival early (when tires are cold and chaos is high) and aggression later (when tires are warm and field is sorted).

**Core Concept:**

- **Lap 1:** Survive (don't break the race)
- **Lap 2:** Assess (learn the field)
- **Lap 3+:** Execute (now race at full pace)

**Why it works:**

- Cold tires = reduced grip = higher incident risk
- Lap 1 chaos = unpredictable drivers = collision risk
- Patience early = better results late

---

## Lap 1: Survival Protocol

**Goals:**

- [ ] Survive Turn 1 (worst case: lose 3 positions, but finish lap)
- [ ] Let aggressive drivers self-destruct
- [ ] Hold position, don't hero

**Mental state:** "I'm invisible. I'm watching chaos, not participating."

**Specific actions:**

- Brake earlier than practice
- Give extra space to cars around you
- If someone dive-bombs, yield
- No passing attempts unless gift-wrapped

**Why:**

- 60-70% of race incidents occur Lap 1-2
- Tires are coldest = grip is lowest
- Drivers are most aggressive = risk is highest

**The trade-off:**
You might lose 1-2 positions on Lap 1. That's fine. You'll gain them back on Lap 3+ when others crash or make mistakes.

---

## Lap 2: Assessment Protocol

**Goals:**

- [ ] Tires warming, car balance improving
- [ ] Identify who's faster/slower
- [ ] Plan attack for L3+

**Mental state:** "I'm a predator. Watching, waiting, learning."

**Specific actions:**

- Study cars ahead for weaknesses
- Note where they're slow
- Maintain gap to car ahead (0.5-1.0s)
- Still no risky moves

**What to look for:**

- Who's braking early? (overtake target)
- Who's fast in straights but slow in corners? (out-brake them)
- Who's erratic? (avoid, let them crash)
- Who's pulling away? (not your target yet)

**Why:**

- Tires are warming but not optimal yet
- Field is spreading out, chaos reducing
- Information gathered now = better attacks later

---

## Lap 3+: Execute Protocol

**Goals:**

- [ ] NOW race at full pace
- [ ] Execute clean overtakes
- [ ] Defend when necessary
- [ ] Push for position

**Mental state:** "I'm a racer. Calculated aggression."

**Specific actions:**

- Attack identified weak points
- Complete passes cleanly
- Don't defend positions unnecessarily early
- Focus on YOUR pace, not theirs

**Why:**

- Tires are warm = full grip available
- Field is sorted = predictable racing
- Chaos has settled = safe to push

**The payoff:**
You've survived the chaos, learned the field, and now you deploy your full pace. This is where you make up positions.

## When to Use

**Use Cold Tire Contract when:**

- ✅ All races (it's a universal protocol)
- ✅ Especially in mixed-skill fields
- ✅ When starting mid-pack or back
- ✅ When tires are actually cold (race start)

**Modify for:**

- Starting P1-P3: You set the pace, but still be cautious Lap 1
- Very short races (< 10 laps): Compress to L1 survive, L2+ execute
- Rolling starts: Tires may be warmer, adjust accordingly

---

## When NOT to Use (Rare)

**Don't use if:**

- ❌ Qualifying race where grid position is critical (must push from L1)
- ❌ You're already 5+ seconds behind leader by L2 (need to push earlier)

**In these cases:** Use modified version - still cautious L1, but push harder L2.

## Cold Tire Contract vs. Meebewegen

**Similarities:**

- Both prioritize safety early
- Both recognize Lap 1 is dangerous
- Both delay full aggression

**Differences:**

| Aspect             | Cold Tire Contract     | Meebewegen                  |
| :----------------- | :--------------------- | :-------------------------- |
| **Focus**          | Tire grip physics      | Field chaos dynamics        |
| **Duration**       | Laps 1-2               | Laps 1-3 (sometimes 1-4)    |
| **Attack Trigger** | Lap 3 (tires ready)    | Lap 4 (field sorted)        |
| **Pace Level**     | 95% (limited by tires) | 85-90% (strategic patience) |
| **Best For**       | All races              | Mixed-skill fields          |

**You can combine both:**

- Lap 1: Cold Tire Contract (tires cold)
- Lap 2: Meebewegen (tires warming, field chaotic)
- Lap 3: Transition (assess)
- Lap 4+: Attack (tires ready, field sorted)

## Master Lonn's Application

**Origin:** Week 02 (Rudskogen)

Master Lonn developed this protocol after recognizing that most incidents happen early when tires are cold and drivers are aggressive.

**Philosophy:**

> "Finishing the race is prio 1. Crashing works against that."

**Results:**

- Consistent clean races
- Better late-race pace (preserved tires/concentration)
- Fewer incidents overall

**Evolution:**
Week 03 (Winton AI race), Master Lonn extended this to "Meebewegen" strategy for even more strategic patience. See [Chapter 13d](13d-meebewegen.md) for details.

## Key Takeaways

✅ **Lap 1 = Survive** - Don't break the race

✅ **Lap 2 = Assess** - Learn the field, plan attacks

✅ **Lap 3+ = Execute** - NOW race at full pace

✅ **Cold tires = reduced grip** - Physics demands caution early

✅ **60-70% of incidents = Lap 1-2** - Statistics support patience

✅ **Lose 2 positions early, gain 5 late** - The trade-off works

## Practice Drill

**Goal:** Execute Cold Tire Contract in AI race.

**Setup:**

1. AI race, 15-20 minutes
2. Qualify mid-pack (P8-P12)
3. Start race with explicit plan:
   - Lap 1: Zero overtake attempts, survive
   - Lap 2: Assess field, no risky moves
   - Lap 3+: Attack

**Success Criteria:**

- ✅ Zero incidents Laps 1-2
- ✅ At least 2 clean overtakes Lap 3+
- ✅ Finished race in better position than Lap 2
- ✅ Felt "in control" throughout
