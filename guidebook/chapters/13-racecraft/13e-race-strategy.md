# Chapter 13e: Race Strategy & Management

**Incidents, pace management, and practice drills**

---

## Part 1: Incident Management

### If You're Hit

**Immediate (< 1 second):**
- Regain control
- Assess damage
- Find safe path

**Short-term (< 10 seconds):**
- Execute 10-Second Rule (Chapter 12)
- Don't retaliate (ruins your race + penalties)
- Protest after if intentional

**Medium-term (next lap):**
- Evaluate: Can you continue?
- Check damage impact on pace
- Adjust goals if necessary

**Mental approach:**
"Okay, that happened. What's my race now?"

### If You Cause an Incident

**Immediate:**
- Slow down if they're off track
- Give them space to rejoin
- Don't make it worse

**Required:**
- Slow and return position if you clearly gained an advantage
- Not required if they punted you off and you stayed on track

**After race:**
- Apologize (even if racing incident)
- Learn from it
- Don't make excuses

**Why:**
Reputation matters. Clean drivers get cleaner racing.

## Part 2: Race Strategy Basics

### Pace Management

**Sprint Races (< 20 minutes):**
- Push from L3 onward
- No tire management needed
- Risk tolerance: Medium-high

**Endurance Races (> 30 minutes):**
- Build pace gradually
- Manage tires (Chapter 14)
- Risk tolerance: Low-medium
- "Slow and steady" often wins

### Position vs. Pace Trade-off

**Question:** Fast car behind, but defending hurts your pace. What do?

**Answer depends on:**
- How much faster are they? (0.2s/lap = defend, 2.0s/lap = let go)
- How many laps left? (5 laps left = defend, 20 laps left = let go)
- What's your race goal? (Fighting for podium = defend, mid-pack = let go)

**Master Lonn's future decision tree:**
```
IF (pace_difference > 1.0s/lap) OR (laps_remaining > 15):
    yield_position()
ELSE IF (fighting_for_podium):
    defend_but_stay_clean()
ELSE:
    race_your_pace()
```

## Part 3: Padawan Practice Drills

### Drill 1: AI Race Practice

**Goal:** Practice racecraft in low-stakes environment.

**Setup:**
- AI race, medium difficulty
- 10-15 minute race
- Goal: NOT to win, but to PRACTICE racecraft

**Focus areas:**
1. Execute Cold Tire Contract (L1-L2 survive)
2. Make 3 clean passes (use proper zones)
3. Defend position once (hold line cleanly)
4. Finish race with zero incidents

**Success criteria:**
All goals achieved > lap time.

### Drill 2: The "Shadow Lap"

**Goal:** Learn to race in traffic without actual racing.

**Setup:**
- Join practice session with other drivers
- Find someone at similar pace
- Follow them for 5-10 laps

**Practice:**
- Stay 0.5-1.0s behind (race distance)
- Predict their moves
- Study where they brake, turn-in, apex
- Imagine overtake opportunities

**Don't actually overtake.**

**Why:**
Builds awareness without pressure. You learn to "see" racecraft.

### Drill 3: Incident Replay Analysis

**Goal:** Learn from others' mistakes.

**Process:**
1. Watch Top Split replays on YouTube
2. Note every incident
3. Answer: "What caused it?"
4. Answer: "How could it be avoided?"
5. Apply lessons to your racing

**Key lesson:**
Most incidents = impatience or unawareness. Be patient. Be aware.

## Master Lonn's Next Frontier

**Current Status (End of Week 03):**
- Hot lapping: Mastered
- Consistency: Improving rapidly
- Technique: Advanced (engine braking, trail braking, racing lines)

**Next Step:**
- AI races: Learn racecraft safely ✅ (Winton victory complete)
- Official races: Apply Cold Tire Contract
- Competitive racing: Bring it all together

**Prediction:**
With your discipline (Cold Tire Contract, Meebewegen) and pace (1:26.090 at Winton), you'll be competitive immediately.

The skill is there. Now it's about managing the chaos.
