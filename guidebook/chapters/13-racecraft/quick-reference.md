# Chapter 13: Racecraft - Quick Reference ⚡

**60-second race day cheat sheet**

---

## Core Principle

Racing isn't about being fastest in isolation. It's about being **fastest relative to competitors** while managing **risk**. Finish the race before you try to win it.

---

## Golden Rules

- **Make the race, don't break it** - 80% of results = staying out of trouble
- **Predictability = Safety** - Hold your line, brake consistently, telegraph moves
- **One defensive move per straight** - Commit early, don't weave
- **Overtake in zones, not dive-bombs** - Plan the pass, execute cleanly

---

## Lap 1-2-3 Protocols

### Lap 1: Survival

- [ ] Brake earlier than practice
- [ ] Give extra space to cars around you
- [ ] If someone dive-bombs → yield
- [ ] Zero passing attempts unless gift-wrapped
- **Mental:** "I'm invisible, watching chaos"

### Lap 2: Assessment

- [ ] Tires warming, car balance improving
- [ ] Identify who's faster/slower/erratic
- [ ] Plan attack for L3+
- **Mental:** "I'm a predator, watching prey"

### Lap 3+: Execute

- [ ] NOW race at full pace
- [ ] Attack identified weak points
- [ ] Defend when necessary
- [ ] Focus on YOUR pace
- **Mental:** "I'm a racer, calculated aggression"

## Overtake Hierarchy (Safest → Riskiest)

1. **DRS/Slipstream Pass** - Draft on straight, pass before brake zone (LOW RISK)
2. **Out-Brake Pass** - Brake later, carry more speed, inside line (MEDIUM RISK)
3. **Switchback** - They take early apex, you take late apex, repass on exit (MEDIUM RISK)
4. **Dive Bomb** - ❌ DON'T DO THIS (HIGH RISK, causes incidents)

---

## Meebewegen Strategy (When to Use)

**What:** Strategic patience - operate at 85-90% pace Laps 1-3, attack Lap 4+

**Use when:**

- Mixed-skill fields (AI races, rookie splits)
- First time at track in race conditions
- ADHD/sensory overwhelm (reduces early chaos)
- Championship points > single race win

**Don't use when:**

- Starting P1-P3 (you set the pace)
- Top split (everyone is fast)
- Very short races (< 10 laps)

**Result:** P11 → P1, zero incidents (Master Lonn, Winton)

---

## Situational Awareness

**Check mirrors:**

- Every brake zone
- Before defensive moves
- After completing passes

**Awareness zones:**

- **Zone 1 (2 car lengths):** Immediate threat - most attention
- **Zone 2 (5 car lengths):** Planning phase - some attention
- **Zone 3 (10+ lengths):** No immediate concern - minimal attention

---

## Incident Management

**If you're hit:**

1. Regain control
2. Execute 10-Second Rule (Chapter 12)
3. Don't retaliate
4. Adjust goals if needed

**If you cause incident:**

1. Slow down, give space
2. Return position if you gained advantage
3. Apologize after race

---

## Race Strategy Quick Decisions

**Fast car behind, defending hurts pace?**

- Pace difference > 1.0s/lap OR laps remaining > 15 → **Let them go**
- Fighting for podium + close pace → **Defend cleanly**
- Otherwise → **Race your pace**

**Sprint vs. Endurance:**

- Sprint (< 20 min): Push from L3, medium-high risk
- Endurance (> 30 min): Build pace gradually, low-medium risk

---

## Red Flags (What NOT to Do)

- ❌ Hero moves on Lap 1
- ❌ Dive-bombing into corners
- ❌ Weaving under braking
- ❌ Defending after being passed (retaliation)
- ❌ Late defensive moves (dangerous)
- ❌ Unpredictable driving (sudden changes)

---

## Key Takeaway

**The slowest looking start often wins the race.** 🐢→🏆

Survive early, attack when it counts, finish clean.
