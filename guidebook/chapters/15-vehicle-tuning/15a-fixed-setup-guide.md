# Chapter 15a: Fixed Setup Guide

**For Ray FF1600 and other fixed setup series**

---

## Welcome to Fixed Setup Racing

**The reality:** Most of your car's setup is LOCKED.

In the Ray FF1600 fixed setup series:
- ❌ Anti-roll bars (ARBs) - LOCKED
- ❌ Springs - LOCKED
- ❌ Dampers - LOCKED
- ❌ Gearing - LOCKED
- ❌ Ride height - LOCKED
- ❌ Alignment - LOCKED

**What you CAN adjust:**
- ✅ **Brake bias** (in-car adjustment)
- ✅ Maybe tire pressure (depends on server rules)

**Translation:** 99% of your lap time comes from DRIVING, not setup.

---

## The Fixed Setup Philosophy

### The Truth

**Everyone has the exact same car.**

- Same ARBs
- Same springs
- Same tire pressure
- Same gearing
- Same everything

**The only variables:**
1. Brake bias (your choice)
2. Your driving (your skill)

**That's it.**

### What This Means

**Good news:**
- ✅ No setup advantage/disadvantage
- ✅ Pure driver vs. driver
- ✅ Can't blame the car (everyone has same one)
- ✅ Focus 100% on technique

**Realization:**
- If someone is faster, it's their DRIVING, not their setup
- If you're slower, fix your TECHNIQUE, not the car
- The baseline setup is already good

**Master Lonn's Journey:**

Week 01-03: Baseline setup. Zero time spent tweaking. All time spent on technique.

Result: 4+ seconds improvement.

**The lesson:** Driving >>> Setup (in fixed series)

---

## Part 1: Brake Bias (Your Main Tool)

**What it does:**
Shifts brake force distribution between front and rear wheels.

**The Numbers:**

- **50%** = Equal front/rear braking
- **55%** = Slightly more front
- **60%** = Significantly more front (front locks first)
- **45%** = More rear (rear locks first)

**Ray FF1600 Typical Range:**
- Most drivers: 56-58%
- Baseline: 57%
- Your sweet spot: Find it yourself

---

### When to Move Brake Bias Forward (+%)

**Symptoms you're experiencing:**
- Rear wheels lock under braking
- Car feels unstable on entry (rear wants to come around)
- Rear slides/spins when trail braking
- Too much rotation on entry

**What increasing brake bias does:**
- More brake force to front
- Less brake force to rear
- More stable platform
- More understeer potential

**How much:** +0.5-1.0% at a time

**Example:** 57.0% → 57.5%

---

### When to Move Brake Bias Backward (-%)

**Symptoms you're experiencing:**
- Front wheels lock under braking
- Car won't rotate (understeers on entry)
- Car feels "dead" on turn-in
- Can't get car pointed

**What decreasing brake bias does:**
- Less brake force to front
- More brake force to rear
- More rotation
- Less stable (rear lighter)

**How much:** -0.5-1.0% at a time

**Example:** 57.0% → 56.5%

---

### Master Lonn's Brake Bias Discovery (Week 02, Rudskogen)

**Starting point:** 56.5% (conservative)

**Problem:** Car wasn't rotating well in slow corners

**Test:** Moved to 57.5% (+1.0%)

**Result:**
- ✅ Better rotation on entry
- ✅ Could brake later (front loaded more)
- ✅ S2 times improved
- ✅ More confidence

**The lesson:** 1% makes a noticeable difference. Worth testing.

**Note:** This was AFTER technique was solid. Not Week 01.

---

## Part 2: Driver vs. Setup Problems

**Critical skill:** Knowing if the problem is YOU or the CAR.

### It's a DRIVER Problem If:

**Characteristics:**
- **Inconsistent** - Sometimes you nail it, sometimes you don't
- **Varies corner-to-corner** - Good in T5, bad in T7
- **Changes lap-to-lap** - Fast lap, then slow lap, then fast again
- **Telemetry shows messy inputs** - Jerky steering, abrupt brake, inconsistent throttle

**Examples:**
- "Sometimes I apex perfectly, sometimes I miss"
- "I'm fast when I focus, slow when distracted"
- "My σ is 0.8s" (high variance)

**The Fix:** PRACTICE, not setup

**What to work on:**
- Consistency drills (Chapter 12)
- Reference points (brake markers, turn-in points)
- Smooth inputs (Chapter 5 - weight transfer)
- Mental game (Chapter 12 - focus)

---

### It's a SETUP Problem If:

**Characteristics:**
- **Consistent** - Happens every lap, every time
- **Specific corner type** - ALL slow corners, or ALL fast corners
- **Same symptom** - Always understeers, always oversteers
- **Good technique, bad result** - Your inputs are clean, car won't respond

**Examples:**
- "Every single slow corner, car pushes wide on entry"
- "Rear locks in EVERY hard braking zone"
- "My telemetry looks good, but car won't turn"

**The Fix (in fixed setup):** Brake bias adjustment

**What to try:**
- Understeer on entry → Reduce brake bias (more rear brake, more rotation)
- Rear locks → Increase brake bias (more front brake, less rear)

**The Reality in Fixed Setup:**

Most "setup problems" are actually technique problems disguised as setup problems.

**Before blaming the car, ask:**
- Is my line optimal? (Chapter 7)
- Is my weight transfer smooth? (Chapter 5)
- Am I trail braking correctly? (Chapter 8)
- Is my σ < 0.3s? (Am I consistent?)

If NO to any of these → It's a driver problem.

---

## Part 3: When to Start Tuning

**The Timeline:**

### DON'T Tune Yet If:

- ❌ Still learning the track
- ❌ Lap times inconsistent (σ > 0.5s)
- ❌ Technique still developing
- ❌ Making different mistakes each lap
- ❌ Haven't watched VRS/coach laps

**Why not:** You can't separate setup effect from technique improvement. You're changing too much lap-to-lap.

---

### START Tuning When:

- ✅ Consistent lap times (σ < 0.3s)
- ✅ Know the track well
- ✅ Technique is solid (smooth inputs, good lines)
- ✅ Have SPECIFIC, REPEATABLE problem
- ✅ Problem persists despite good technique

**Why now:** You can isolate the setup change effect.

---

### Master Lonn's Timeline

**Week 01:**
- Baseline setup (default)
- Focus: Learning track, basic technique
- Setup changes: ZERO

**Week 02-03:**
- Baseline setup (mostly)
- One brake bias test (57.5%) - worked!
- Focus: Technique refinement (engine braking, T5 breakthrough)
- Setup changes: ONE (brake bias)

**Week 10+ (maybe):**
- Technique solid
- Start experimenting with brake bias more
- Test different settings for different tracks
- Setup changes: STILL MINIMAL (it's fixed setup!)

**Season 2 (if open setup series):**
- Time for deep dive
- Read Open Setup Reference (Chapter 15b)
- Systematic testing of ARBs, tire pressure, etc.

**The Pattern:** Technique FIRST, setup LATER. Always.

---

## Part 4: The Testing Process

**When you DO test brake bias:**

### Step 1: Baseline Establishment

1. **Drive 5-10 laps** (consistent pace, no pushing limits)
2. **Record data:**
   - Best lap time
   - Average lap time (5 fastest)
   - Consistency (σ)
   - Where problems occur
3. **Note feeling:**
   - Does rear lock? Front lock?
   - Understeer or oversteer?
   - Which corners?

**This is your baseline.**

---

### Step 2: Make ONE Change

**Example:** Brake bias 57.0% → 57.5%

**Only change ONE thing.** Don't touch anything else.

---

### Step 3: Test (5-10 laps)

Same process as baseline:
- Consistent pace
- Same conditions (tire temp, track temp)
- Focus on problem area

---

### Step 4: Compare

**Lap times:**
- Faster? Slower? Same?

**Feel:**
- Did problem improve?
- Did something else get worse?
- More confidence?

**Data (if available):**
- Does telemetry show difference?
- Less lockup?
- Better balance?

---

### Step 5: Decide

**If improvement:**
- ✅ Keep the change
- Maybe try another 0.5%? (test again)

**If worse:**
- ❌ Revert the change
- Maybe try opposite direction? (test again)

**If no difference:**
- 🤷 Either keep it or revert
- Problem might be technique, not setup

---

## Common Mistakes in Fixed Setup

### Mistake 1: Blaming the Car

**The Trap:**
"Car won't turn!" "Setup is bad!" "Need to change something!"

**The Reality:**
Everyone has the same car. If others are faster, it's not the setup.

**The Fix:**
Watch faster drivers. Study their technique. Practice YOUR driving.

---

### Mistake 2: Tweaking Too Early

**The Trap:**
Week 01, already adjusting brake bias every session.

**The Problem:**
You're improving so fast through technique that you can't tell if brake bias helped or if you just got better.

**The Fix:**
Baseline setup for first month. Focus on driving. Adjust LATER when technique plateaus.

---

### Mistake 3: Multiple Changes

**The Trap:**
"I'll change brake bias AND tire pressure together!"

**The Problem:**
Car feels different. Was it brake bias? Tire pressure? Both? Neither?

**The Fix:**
One change. Test. Evaluate. Next change.

---

### Mistake 4: Chasing Perfect

**The Trap:**
"I need the PERFECT brake bias! Testing 57.0%, 57.5%, 58.0%, 57.2%, 57.8%..."

**The Reality:**
There's no "perfect." There's "good enough."

**The Fix:**
Find brake bias that feels good. Stop tweaking. Focus on DRIVING.

**The difference between 57.0% and 57.5%?** Maybe 0.05s/lap. Maybe.

**The difference between good and great driving?** 2-3 seconds/lap.

**Priorities.**

---

## Key Takeaways

✅ **Fixed setup = focus on driving** (99% of lap time)

✅ **Brake bias = your only tool** (0.5-1.0% changes)

✅ **Driver problem vs. setup problem** (usually driver)

✅ **Tune LATE, not early** (technique first, tweaking later)

✅ **Test systematically** (baseline → change → test → evaluate)

✅ **Everyone has same car** (faster = better driving)

✅ **Good enough > perfect** (stop tweaking, start driving)
