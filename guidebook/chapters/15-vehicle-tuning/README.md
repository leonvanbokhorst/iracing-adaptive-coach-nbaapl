## Important Note for Ray FF1600 Racing

**You're racing FIXED SETUP series!**

Most of this chapter doesn't apply to you RIGHT NOW. The Ray FF1600 fixed setup locks:
- ❌ Anti-roll bars (ARBs)
- ❌ Springs
- ❌ Dampers
- ❌ Gearing
- ❌ Ride height

**What you CAN adjust:**
- ✅ **Brake bias** (in-car, critical)
- ✅ Maybe tire pressure (depends on server)

**That's it!**

## 📚 The Two Guides

### [Fixed Setup Guide](15a-fixed-setup-guide.md) ⚡
**~250 lines | For Ray FF1600 and other fixed series**

**Read this NOW if:**
- Racing Ray FF1600 (or any fixed setup series)
- Want to know what you CAN adjust
- Need brake bias guidance
- Want to separate driver issues from setup issues

**Topics:**
- Understanding fixed setup racing
- Brake bias (your main tool)
- Driver vs. setup problems
- When tuning actually matters
- Master Lonn's brake bias discoveries

**Start here:** This is YOUR current chapter.

---

### [Open Setup Reference](15b-open-setup-reference.md) 📖
**~500 lines | For future open setup series**

**Read this LATER when:**
- Racing open setup series
- Different car with adjustable setup
- Season 2+ when you want deeper optimization

**Topics:**
- Full setup theory (ARBs, springs, dampers)
- Balance adjustments (understeer/oversteer)
- Tire pressure optimization
- Systematic testing process
- Advanced diagnostics

**Save for future:** You'll need this eventually, but not in Ray FF1600 fixed.

## Why This Split Matters

**The Problem:**
Original Chapter 15 was 724 lines of setup theory. But ~500 lines were about adjustments you CAN'T MAKE in fixed setup!

**The Solution:**
- **Fixed Setup Guide:** What matters NOW (brake bias, driver vs. setup)
- **Open Setup Reference:** Full theory for LATER (when you need it)

**The Philosophy:**
Don't study what you can't use. Focus on what you CAN control: **your driving**.

In fixed setup racing:
- Everyone has the same car
- Faster drivers = better technique, not better setup
- Your edge comes from DRIVING, not tweaking

## Master Lonn's Setup Journey

**Week 01-03:**
- Baseline setup (good enough!)
- Focus: Technique, not tuning
- Only adjustment: Brake bias (57.5% at Rudskogen)

**Week 10+ (maybe):**
- Technique solid
- Experiment with brake bias more
- Still fixed setup = limited changes

**Season 2 (open setup series):**
- Time for deep dive
- Read Open Setup Reference
- Systematic optimization

**The timeline:** Driving first, setup later. Always.

## Key Insight

**In fixed setup racing:**

```
Faster lap time = Better driving
(NOT better setup)
```

**Everyone has the same car. The difference is YOU.**
