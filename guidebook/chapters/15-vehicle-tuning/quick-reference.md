**Brake bias cheat sheet for fixed setup series**

---

## Fixed Setup Reality Check

**Ray FF1600 = FIXED SETUP**

**You CAN adjust:**
- ✅ Brake bias (in-car)
- ✅ Maybe tire pressure (server dependent)

**You CANNOT adjust:**
- ❌ ARBs, springs, dampers, gearing, ride height

**Translation:** Focus on DRIVING, not tweaking.

---

## Brake Bias Quick Guide

**What it does:** Shifts brake force between front/rear wheels

**The numbers:**
- **50%** = Equal front/rear
- **60%** = More front (front locks first)
- **40%** = More rear (rear locks first)

**Ray FF1600 typical:** 56-58% (slightly front-biased)

---

## When to Adjust Brake Bias

### Move Forward (+0.5-1.0%)

**Symptoms:**
- Rear locks under braking
- Car unstable on entry
- Rear wants to come around

**Result:** More front brake, less rear brake, more stability

---

### Move Backward (-0.5-1.0%)

**Symptoms:**
- Front locks under braking
- Car won't rotate
- Understeer on entry

**Result:** Less front brake, more rear brake, more rotation

---

## Master Lonn's Discovery

**Week 02, Rudskogen:**
- Started: 56.5%
- Tested: 57.5%
- Result: Better rotation, can brake later, S2 improved

**The lesson:** 0.5-1.0% makes a difference. Test it.

---

## Testing Process

1. **Baseline:** Drive 5 laps, note brake lockup behavior
2. **Adjust:** Change by 0.5-1.0% (one direction)
3. **Test:** Drive 5 more laps
4. **Compare:** Better, worse, or same?
5. **Decide:** Keep or revert

**Change ONE thing. Test. Evaluate.**

## Driver vs. Setup Problem

### It's a DRIVER problem if:
- Inconsistent (sometimes good, sometimes bad)
- Varies corner-to-corner
- Telemetry shows messy inputs

**Fix:** Practice, not setup

---

### It's a SETUP problem if:
- Consistent every lap, every corner
- Specific handling characteristic
- Can't fix with technique

**Fix:** Adjust brake bias (or accept it in fixed setup)

---

## When to Start Tuning

**DON'T adjust yet if:**
- Still learning track
- Lap times inconsistent (> 0.5s σ)
- Technique still developing

**START adjusting when:**
- Consistent laps (< 0.3s σ)
- Know track well
- Technique solid
- Have specific, repeatable problem

**Master Lonn's timeline:** Week 03+, maybe experiment with brake bias. That's it.

## The Golden Rule

**In fixed setup racing:**

```
Everyone has the same car.
Faster = better driving, not better setup.
```

**Your edge is technique, not tweaking.**

---

## Key Takeaways

✅ **Ray FF1600 = fixed setup** (very limited adjustments)

✅ **Brake bias = your main tool** (0.5-1.0% at a time)

✅ **Driver problem vs. setup problem** (fix technique first)

✅ **Test systematically** (baseline → change → test → evaluate)

✅ **Don't tune too early** (technique first, tweaking later)

✅ **Everyone has same car** (your edge = driving)
