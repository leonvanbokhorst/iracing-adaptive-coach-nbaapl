Paradox session: Objectively faster (0.3s improvement) and WAY more consistent (6x improvement in σ), but Master Lonn felt 'all over the place' and 'no feel'. Classic overdriving symptom. S2 is locked in (0.28s loss, σ = 0.19s). Key insight: Can't brute-force feel. Need to dial back to 95% and build rhythm first. The disconnect between objective improvement and subjective feeling is strong."

    "Pushing harder doesn't always equal better results for ADHD drivers - need rhythm and reference points",
    "When S1 is messy, S3 suffers (cascade effect)",
    "Master Lonn's brain needs the mental model to match physical execution or it feels chaotic"

  "next_steps": [
    "STOP chasing lap time, START chasing rhythm",
    "Dial back to 95% effort in S1 to find the FEEL",
    "Pick ONE braking point, ONE turn-in, ONE throttle point - repeat 5 laps identically",
    "Target: S1 average under 28.5s with σ under 0.5s",
    "Goal: 5 consecutive laps where S1 is within 0.2s of each other",
    "Use S2 feeling (which is locked in) as reference for how S1 should feel",
    "After rhythm is established at 95%, THEN push for lap time"
