## Key Insights

Master Lonn, I analyzed your first Rudskogen session. Here's what the data tells us:

### What the Data Shows

**Sector Breakdown**:
- Sector 1: 0.40s loss/lap (7.1s total)
- **Sector 2: 0.96s loss/lap (17.3s total)** ← 3x worse than others
- Sector 3: 0.31s loss/lap (5.5s total)
- Sector 4: 0.29s loss/lap (5.2s total)

**Theoretical Optimal**: 1:29.993 (combining best sectors)
**Gap to Optimal**: 0.30s (you're close to your potential!)

### What It Means

Your instinct about the Angst hill (Sector 2) was spot on. The data confirms it's where you're losing the most time:

- **Best S2**: 30.85s
- **Average S2**: 31.81s
- **Variance**: 0.75s (inconsistent)

The good news: Your other sectors are relatively consistent (0.29-0.40s loss). This means once you nail S2, you'll see significant lap time improvement.

## Focus Area

**Sector 2 Consistency (Angst Hill)**

**Why this matters**:
- 0.96s loss per lap = 17.3s over 18 laps
- 3x more loss than any other sector
- High variance (0.75s) suggests inconsistent approach
- You're already close to your theoretical optimal (0.30s gap)

**Goal for next session**:
- **S2 average under 31.0s** (currently 31.81s)
- **S2 variance under 0.5s** (currently 0.75s)

This would save you ~0.8s per lap immediately.

## Progress Tracking

| Session | Best | Average | S2 Avg | S2 σ | Notes |
|---------|------|---------|--------|------|-------|
| 2025-12-18 | 1:30.290 | 1:31.948 | 31.81s | 0.75s | Baseline session |

---

## Next Steps

1. **Focus on ONE consistent line through S2**
   - Pick a brake marker and stick to it
   - Commit on exit (data suggests hesitation)

2. **Track S2 times next session**
   - Goal: Average under 31.0s
   - Don't worry about overall lap time yet

3. **Come back after next session**
   - I'll track your S2 progress
   - We'll adjust based on data

## Notes

- Master Lonn prefers numbers over charts (noted for future sessions)
- First session at Rudskogen - solid baseline
- Clear focus area identified
- Close to theoretical optimal - consistency work will unlock pace
