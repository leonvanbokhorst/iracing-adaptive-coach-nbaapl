# Circuito de Navarra – Wind on the Plateau

Circuito de Navarra sits out on the plains near Los Arcos, dropped between vineyards and wind farms like someone decided a GT circuit and a bike track belonged in the middle of big sky country.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circuito_de_Navarra">Circuito de Navarra — Wikipedia</a></sup> Opened in 2010 as Spain’s newest FIA Grade 2 venue, it’s since been adopted by everything from Spanish superbikes to Ferrari Challenge and long-distance GT fields.

When MotorSport Vision took over the circuit they resurfaced it, reprofiled Turn 6 and, in 2024, completed the extension and layout tweaks that gave us the current 2.693 km “Speed Circuit – Medium” configuration.<sup><a href="https://www.circuitodenavarra.com/about/circuit-layouts">Circuit Layouts — Circuito de Navarra</a></sup> It trims off the long back stretch of the full course and compresses the action into a compact eight-corner loop: fast opening sweepers, an uphill dive into a corkscrew, then a tight, technical stadium that spits you back onto the start/finish.

On the map it looks simple. On the sim rig it feels like a **test of how much speed you dare carry while a crosswind leans on the car.**

## Character Notes

- **Balanced by design** – Navarra’s medium layout is a “bit of everything” lap: fast T1–T2, a big braking event into the T5 corkscrew, then a busy final sector that feels almost like a kart track strung across a hillside.<sup><a href="https://www.racingcircuits.info/europe/spain/navarra.html">Navarra — RacingCircuits.info</a></sup>
- **Surface as confidence boost** – After the MSV resurfacing the asphalt is glassy-smooth. That invites greed: higher minimum speeds, later braking, bigger experiments. The limit arrives quietly but quickly.
- **Wind as invisible corner** – The circuit sits on open terrain. In reality and in sim, wind can subtly shove you wide at the end of the main straight or into the fast right-handers. If the car keeps “mysteriously” drifting to the same side, it’s not your alignment—it's the air.
- **Sequenced sectors** – The lap falls naturally into four rhythm zones:  
  T1–T2 fast sweep, the T3–T5 climb and drop, the T6–T8 stadium, and the double-right back onto the straight. Treat each zone as a mini-story instead of eight isolated corners.

## Ray FF1600 at Navarra

In the Ray FF1600, Navarra’s medium loop feels like a **momentum exam** with a short attention span: the track keeps changing what it asks of you every few seconds.

- **Bias & braking behaviour**  
  Start the week with a neutral, front-leaning brake bias in the low-50s. You want stability into the downhill, slightly curved braking for T5 before you ask for rotation. As you grow comfortable, edge the bias a touch rearward for the T6–T8 stadium: it helps the car pivot into those slower corners without dragging the front tires.

- **T1–T2: setting tone**  
  The opening right–left is where timid drivers lose half a second for free. In the Ray, focus on a confident, slightly later turn-in for T1 and a gentle lift rather than a full brake. If you can arrive at T2 with the car already settled and only one clean steering input, the run to T3 becomes a launch instead of a recovery.

- **T5 corkscrew: patience over heroics**  
  Braking uphill into a tightening left that immediately drops away is classic “send it” bait. Resist. Brake a fraction earlier than you think, straighten the car before the heaviest pedal pressure, and release the brakes smoothly as the road falls away. If you’re still trail braking when the car crests, the Ray tends to pirouette for the crowd.

- **Stadium section: kart-track brain**  
  T6–T8 are where Ray drivers make or lose the lap. Think third-gear roll speed and minimal steering angle. If you can keep your hands quiet and your minimum speed consistent, you exit T8 with options: defend the inside for the double-right, or open the steering early and maximise drive back to the line.

- **Double right onto the straight**  
  The final two rights decide both your lap time and your racecraft. In practice, experiment with a slightly later apex on the first right so you can straighten the car earlier for the second. In races, be willing to sacrifice a bit of apex speed to guarantee a clean, full-throttle exit—especially if someone is filling your mirrors.

## Practice Cues for the Week

Treat Navarra as your “sector discipline” track: how cleanly can you connect distinct rhythm zones?

- **Day 1 – Sector mapping**  
  Run at 80% pace and name sectors in your head: “fast sweep”, “corkscrew”, “stadium”, “double right”. Notice where your breathing spikes and where it calms down. Those spikes mark the corners that will fall apart first in traffic.

- **Day 2 – T5 + stadium focus**  
  Dedicate an entire session to T5 and T6–T8. Enter a little slower than you think you need, feel for one long rotation instead of a late lunge, and use partial throttle to stabilise the Ray on the way down the hill. If you can make that middle of the lap feel boringly repeatable, your race pace will be brutal.

- **Race runs – Draft and exits**  
  In races, your best overtakes in the Ray usually start in the stadium and finish at the end of the main straight. Use the technical section to pressure people into poor exits, then take a shallow line through the final double-right to launch onto the front stretch. Don’t fight every move into T1; sometimes letting someone dive you and crossing back on exit is the smarter, lower-risk play.
