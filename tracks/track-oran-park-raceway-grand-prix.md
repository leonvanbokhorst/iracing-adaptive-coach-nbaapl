# Oran Park Raceway – Suburban Fever Dream

Oran Park was Sydney’s suburban coliseum: carved out of Dan Cleary’s farmland in 1962, slowly expanded with extra loops, and crowned in the 1970s with that wonderfully odd figure-eight bridge.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oran_Park_Raceway">Oran Park Raceway — Wikipedia</a></sup> By the time the bulldozers came for housing in 2010, it had seen Tasman Series heroes, thundering Formula 5000s, two Australian Grands Prix, endless touring-car wars and the final fireworks of the V8 Supercars Championship.

Fans loved it because you could see almost everything from one grassy bank: cars diving off the front straight into Pits Bend, threading back under and over the bridge, and arcing through Suttons while cockatoos complained overhead. It felt more backyard festival than corporate motorsport.

The Grand Prix loop was a kind of low-rise rollercoaster: not much raw elevation, but constant camber tricks, bumps and direction changes. Pits Bend dropped away just as you wanted to brake, Coca-Cola corner pinched tighter than it looked, the run to the bridge was a rhythm test, and crossing over your own previous braking line at full chat never stopped feeling slightly surreal. The final double-apex at Suttons was all or nothing: nail the inner ripple strip and the car fired onto the short straight; miss your line and you’d bog down before the start/finish kink.

## Character Notes

- **Figure-eight weirdness** – There aren’t many circuits where you literally drive over your own approach line. That bridge makes Oran Park feel like a grown-up kart track that someone dropped into suburbia.
- **Bumps with stories** – Decades of patching left little quirks in braking zones and corner entries. Local knowledge was a competitive advantage: “avoid the shiny tar at X, commit hard at Y.”
- **No real straights, just chances to breathe** – With only short chutes between corners, there’s nowhere to hide bad exits. Every missed apex shows up in the next two sectors.
- **Crowd energy baked in** – The compact layout meant the crowd was always close. In your head, every off at Castrol or Suttons happens in front of _everyone_.

## Ray FF1600 at Oran Park

For the Ray FF1600, Oran Park is basically fan-service. It’s a **momentum playground** where bravery is less important than staying light on your hands and honest with your exits.

- **Pits Bend + Coca-Cola**  
  Dropping into Pits Bend, you want calm, early braking and a line that opens up the entry to Coca-Cola. In the Ray, think: “slow the platform once, then carry.” Over-attacking Pits Bend to “win” T1 just makes you late and narrow into Coca-Cola, which hurts all the way up to the bridge.

- **Coca-Cola corner**  
  This tight right loves drivers who rotate the car early and prioritise getting back to throttle without saw-toothing the steering. Second gear, one clean trail-brake, let the nose bite, then unwind and go. If you’re adding steering at the point where you should be accelerating, you entered too hot.

- **Bridge approach and crossing**  
  The run up to the bridge is about trust. You’re climbing, the track narrows, and your braking references are fencing and marshal posts rather than big boards. In the Ray, arrive a fraction calmer than you think you can get away with, get the car straight before your main brake hit, and accept a slightly conservative crest the first few sessions. Confidence here is built, not forced.

- **Revett and the infield rhythm**  
  The left-right through Revett is where your steering discipline shows. Pick a line that lets the car change direction once, not three times, and use a breath of throttle to keep it stable. The FF1600 will reward a smooth, almost lazy input with surprising minimum speed.

- **Suttons double-apex**  
  This is the money corner. Trail the brake gently into the first apex, feel the front bite, then give yourself a micro-pause mid-corner: a tiny lift, a breath, and then open the wheel to let the car drift towards the second apex. Done right, you’re already rolling into third as you pass it and the Ray slingshots onto the straight; done wrong, you’re either understeering out to the dust or stuck in “waiting for grip” limbo.

- **Brake bias & bumps**  
  Because of the surface character, a slightly more front-biased brake setting can make life easier early in the week—especially into Pits Bend and Coca-Cola. As you start to memorise which bumps you can ignore and which you can’t, easing the bias back a touch lets the Ray rotate more eagerly into the medium-speed stuff without getting too skatey over the bridge landing.

## Practice Cues for the Week

Use Oran Park as your **“old-school flow” lab**.

- **20-lap rhythm runs**  
  Open the week with longer stints where you don’t chase lap time at all. Focus on keeping the same rhythm from Pits Bend through Coca-Cola to the bridge: braking at the same points, turning with the same steering rate, and noticing when you start to rush.

- **Bridge & Suttons focus**  
  Dedicate one session purely to the bridge sequence and the final corner. Your goal: arrive calm, leave fast. If you can exit Suttons with the same gear, same revs and same steering angle five laps in a row, you’re ahead of most of the split.

- **Traffic rehearsal**  
  Oran Park gets tight fast. Run AI or ghost races where you practice making passes only on the run into Suttons or out of Coca-Cola, never with desperation moves mid-bridge. That trains you to think a couple of corners ahead in a car that really cannot afford divebomb repairs.

Drive it right in the Ray, and Oran Park feels like a slightly chaotic backyard party you’ve somehow been invited to headline: short, intense, a bit rowdy—and over way too soon.
