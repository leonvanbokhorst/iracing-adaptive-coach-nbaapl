# Rudskogen Motorsenter – Forest Rollercoaster

Rudskogen opened in 1990 as Norway’s first permanent asphalt circuit, cut into the rocky pine forest south-east of Oslo.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudskogen">Rudskogen — Wikipedia</a></sup> In 2006 it became the country’s official national motorsport facility, and Hermann Tilke was brought in to stretch and sculpt it into the modern 3.254 km layout: 14 corners, a 640-metre straight and about 42 metres of elevation change packed into a tight forest bowl.<sup><a href="https://www.racingcircuits.info/europe/norway/rudskogen.html">Rudskogen — RacingCircuits.info</a></sup>

Today the same strip of tarmac hosts STCC and GT weekends, superkarts, drift events and police driver training. It’s very Scandinavian: one part high-speed theatre, one part very serious classroom.

The Grand Prix lap feels like a rally stage that decided to become a circuit. Fast, loaded arcs that climb and plunge through the trees, awkwardly late apexes that only make sense once you’ve overshot them a few times, and braking zones that tilt _just_ enough to keep your ABS foot honest. The forest walls close in, turning the whole thing into a tunnel of rock, bark and Armco.

## Character Notes

- **Forest canyon** – Trees, rock faces and guardrails sit close, so your peripheral vision is always busy. It feels more like a hillclimb built on a loop than a wide-open GP circuit.
- **Elevation with attitude** – The climb through T3–T4 and the plunge into T6 define the lap. You’re braking and turning while the car is either still climbing or already falling, so weight transfer is never neutral.
- **Long arcs, late secrets** – Several corners are really long, bending sequences with late apexes hiding around the bend. If you turn in “where it looks right”, you arrive early and pay for it all the way down the next hill.
- **Scandi dual-purpose** – Some days it’s GTs and Porsches hanging it out at the edge; other days it’s police-training fleets and trackday heroes practising safe lines. The layout has to be fun _and_ educational—and it is.

## Ray FF1600 at Rudskogen

In the Ray FF1600, Rudskogen becomes a **momentum and bravery calibration tool**. You rarely sit still on the wheel; you’re either loading, releasing or catching the car.

- **T1–T3: opening the flow**  
  The first complex sets the tone. Turn 1 and the following kinks want calm, early inputs: brake a little sooner than you think, get the Ray pointed, and then let it _roll_ into the uphill right of T3. If you try to bully T3 with late braking and extra steering, you just bleed speed for the long climb that follows.

- **The uphill sweeper (T3/T4)**  
  This is one of the “hero corners”. In the Ray, you’re in the classic momentum dilemma: lift and lose time, or commit and trust the car. Start with a small, early lift and let the car take a wide, climbing line; as confidence grows, move that lift closer to turn-in and reduce its size. The car will take more mid-corner speed than your eyes initially believe—if your hands are quiet.

- **Back straight and T6 braking**  
  The 640 m straight is only as good as your exit onto it. A clean, unwound steering wheel before full throttle matters more than squeezing the last km/h out of the previous corner. Braking into T6 is uphill-then-downhill, so the car gets light just as you want max pedal. Get your big brake hit done while the chassis is still supported, then bleed off pressure as you crest so the rear doesn’t start to wander.

- **Middle bowl (T7–T11)**  
  This section is a flowing, medium-speed bowl where the Ray feels completely in its element. The trick is to think in shapes, not corners: one long, linking line through the left-rights, with the throttle breathing instead of stabbing. Over-drive one part and you spend the next two correcting; keep it smooth and the car just keeps pouring speed into the next kink.

- **Final sector and last stop**  
  The closing corners bring you back downhill with another important braking event. Fatigue plus falling elevation equals “just a bit too deep” lockups. In the Ray, give yourself the gift of a slightly earlier, straighter brake here and focus on one last clean exit. Over a race stint, the drivers who respect the last braking zone usually end up ahead of those who try to win the lap there.

- **Brake bias & crests**  
  Early in the week, a front-leaning bias (a couple of clicks towards safety) keeps the rear composed over the T6 and final braking crests. As tyre temps and your courage rise, nudging the bias back towards neutral lets the Ray rotate more willingly into the quicker direction changes—but every extra step rearward means you have to be even smoother when the road falls away.

## Practice Cues for the Week

Let Rudskogen be your **“forest flow” dojo** in the Ray.

- **Sector 1 & uphill sweeper drills**  
  Spend early sessions just looping the opening sector. Aim to get three consecutive laps where your minimum speed through the uphill right is within a tiny window and your steering input looks like one continuous sweep, not a series of corrections.

- **T6 braking repeatability**  
  Dedicate a stint purely to the T6 stop. Pick a marker you can see from inside the “tunnel” of trees—fence post, marshal box, change in armco colour—and practise braking at that exact point every lap. Watch for when the rear starts to feel light over the crest; that’s your cue to smooth out the pedal, not move it later.

- **Race runs in dirty air**  
  In longer runs, deliberately sit in someone’s wake through the bowl section. The Ray loses just enough front grip in dirty air to force you to be tidy: slightly earlier turn-ins, softer hands, and more patience on throttle. If you can keep your rhythm without a clean view of the apex, Rudskogen has really started to live in your body.

Once it clicks, Rudskogen stops feeling like an intimidating forest stage and starts feeling like a high-speed hiking trail you know by heart: you’re no longer wondering what’s behind the next crest—you’re already setting the car up for it.
