# VIR North Course – Greatest Hits Loop

When VIR was resurrected in 2000, it didn’t just bring back the legendary Full Course; it came back as a modular playground. The 2.25-mile North Course is basically a “best of VIR” mixtape, stitching together the Horseshoe, the Snake, the Climbing Esses, Oak Tree and the Roller Coaster into one condensed lap.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_International_Raceway">Virginia International Raceway — Wikipedia</a></sup>

It shares the same front straight and back section as the Full Course, then dives off onto a connector after Oak Tree to loop you back to pit lane. Bikes, club racers and test days love it because you get all the character without the extra real estate.

On paper, North is just a trimmed Full Course. In the car it’s intense: medium-speed complexes, big elevation swings (over 100 feet from lowest to highest), blind crests and no real “relax” sectors. It’s one of those layouts where, if you’re not slightly ahead of the car mentally, the track will put you there physically.

## Character Notes

- **Compressed VIR** – All the names you know—Horseshoe, Snake, Climbing Esses, Oak Tree, Roller Coaster, Hog Pen—are here, just arranged in a tighter loop.
- **Elevation as drama** – The Climbing Esses and the drop through Roller Coaster/Hog Pen use vertical load as much as lateral. The car is constantly either digging into the hill or trying to go light over a brow.
- **Flow over fragments** – North doesn’t reward thinking in single corners. The Snake into the Esses, and Oak Tree into the straight, are sequences that only make sense if you drive them as one big thought.
- **Old-school edges** – Grass, walls, earth banks. Go a metre too far at the end of Hog Pen or over-commit in the Esses and the circuit reminds you it’s been around since the ’50s.

## Ray FF1600 at VIR North

In the Ray FF1600, VIR North is a **high-speed trust exercise**. You don’t have the power to brute-force your way out of bad exits, so every small hesitation shows up in your delta.

- **Horseshoe (T1/T2)**  
  The opening right–left decides your run through the Snake. In the Ray, a gentle but committed brake into the first apex, then a long, drawn-out release as you arc back to the left works best. Think “double-apex with one brake shape” rather than two separate corners. The earlier you can unwind the steering and get back to throttle, the more alive the car feels through the following section.

- **The Snake into Climbing Esses**  
  The Snake is your set-up: small steering, small lifts, no heroics. You want to arrive at the base of the Climbing Esses already tidy and roughly placed. In the FF1600, picking a taller gear and treating the Esses as one continuous slalom is key. Tiny steering inputs, a stable throttle (or very gentle breaths), and absolute refusal to make last-second corrections. A mid-Esses lift upsets the car more than a controlled little slide.

- **Oak Tree (even without the tree)**  
  Still the slowest point on the lap and the kingmaker for the back straight. Second gear in the Ray, brake in a straight line, and be patient on turn-in. Aim for a later apex than your eyes want to; you want to be opening the wheel and squeezing throttle just as you pass the geometric apex, not before. If you’re holding lock while going to power, you’re compromising the straight and the whole next sector pays the price.

- **Back straight & braking into Roller Coaster**  
  In a momentum car, this is less about speed gain and more about how relaxed you can be. Use the straight to reset your breathing, glance at temps, and prepare for the heavy brake at the top of the hill. Braking into Roller Coaster is tricky: the track falls away under you. Get your main brake hit done early, while the car is still supported, then taper off as you tip in. Any late, aggressive trail-brake right as the track drops will make the rear feel like it wants to overtake you.

- **Hog Pen**  
  Hog Pen is a patience and balance test. In the Ray, treat it as “slow the car once, then ride the hill.” A brief, firm brake, a calm turn-in, and then a whisper of throttle to keep the rear planted as you let the car fall down the hill. The exit curb is your friend as long as you arrive straight; if you’re still adding lock at the bottom, you’ll be in the grass before you can say “1x”.

- **Brake bias choices**  
  Early in the week, a slightly front-leaning bias makes T1 and Roller Coaster less sketchy, especially as you learn where the car goes light. As confidence grows and your brake releases smooth out, a nudge rearward can help the Ray rotate more willingly into the Horseshoe and Oak Tree—just remember VIR’s crests will punish any jabby pedal work.

## Practice Cues for the Week

Let VIR North be your **“rhythm at speed”** track in the Ray.

- **Snake + Esses sector drill**  
  Devote early stints purely to the Snake and Climbing Esses. Don’t chase ultimate pace yet; chase laps where your steering trace is one smooth wave and your throttle stays above ~60% the whole way up. If you need big mid-Esses corrections, wind the pace back and rebuild.

- **Oak Tree exit obsession**  
  Do a session where your only goal is: “best possible exit from Oak Tree, every lap.” Arrive a bit under the limit, experiment with different brake release timings and apex points, and watch how early you can go to full throttle without running out of road. Your back-straight speed in the Ray is almost entirely Oak Tree-dependent.

- **Roller Coaster & Hog Pen at reduced pace**  
  Run a few laps at 80% specifically focusing on how the car feels as the hill drops away. Practise braking earlier, releasing more gently, and letting the car take a set before you commit to throttle. Once that feels boringly safe, layer speed back in without changing the calmness of your inputs.

When VIR North finally “clicks” in the FF1600, the lap stops feeling like a series of survival tests and starts feeling like a dance kata: big, sweeping motions you already know, performed smoothly at real speed.
