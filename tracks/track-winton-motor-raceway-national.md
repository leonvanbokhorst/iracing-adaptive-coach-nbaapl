# Winton Motor Raceway (National) – Clothesline Grand Prix

Winton grew out of a very Australian kind of stubbornness. The Benalla Auto Club wanted a permanent home, so volunteers went out into dairy country, staked out a rough loop and laid bitumen through the paddocks. On 26 November 1961, Victoria’s newest circuit opened to around 10,000 spectators, cows probably unimpressed in the background.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winton_Motor_Raceway">Winton Motor Raceway — Wikipedia</a></sup>

In 1997 the original “club” layout was stretched into today’s 3.0 km National Circuit, with the old loop still tucked inside like a matryoshka doll. Touring cars, Formula Ford, the Australian Drivers’ Championship and Supercars’ Winton SuperSprint have all hammered around this place. It didn’t pick the nickname “Australia’s Action Track” by accident: tight sightlines, constant direction changes and short straights mean cars are never far apart for long.

Dick Johnson once compared Winton to “running a marathon around your clothesline,” and he wasn’t wrong. The track is basically a sequence of linked hairpins, kinks and off-camber transitions, stitched together with just enough straight to make you think you can relax before the next brake zone appears.

## Character Notes

- **Paddock-born, paddock-feeling** – Flat farmland, hay bales, low buildings and wind across the infield. It feels more like someone paved a go-kart fantasy through a field than a grand, sculpted facility.
- **Short lap, long workload** – Twelve corners on 3.0 km means you’re constantly either braking, turning or trying to get back to throttle. There is no “sit down and chill” zone.
- **Bumps and off-camber traps** – Braking into T3 and T10 is never quite as smooth as you want, and several corners tilt away from you just enough to punish late, greedy entries.
- **Wind as permanent variable** – A crosswind down the back straight or across the infield can move your braking points by metres. Locals learn to trust the paint on the pit buildings and the feel of the car more than the boards.

## Ray FF1600 at Winton National

In the Ray FF1600, Winton is a **discipline and traction exam** disguised as a tiny club circuit. You’ve got just enough power that every poor exit hurts, and not nearly enough that you can ignore the mistakes.

- **T1–T3: settling into the clothesline**  
  T1 and T2 arrive quickly and often. In the Ray, you want calm, early braking into T1 with a focus on exit more than entry. T2 and the braking into T3 are where you immediately feel the bumps: get the car straight before you really lean on the pedal, and don’t be afraid to brake a fraction earlier to keep the platform calm. A safe, slightly front-biased brake setup helps you sleep at night here.

- **Turn 2 hairpin & rotation**  
  T2 is one of the lap’s key anchors. Second gear, early but controlled trail-braking, and an emphasis on rotating the car early so you can open the wheel and drive out. If you’re still adding lock when you want to be on throttle, you came in too hot or too shallow.

- **Middle complex & Turn 6**  
  The sequence through the infield—including the left–right leading into T6—rewards what the Ray does best: small steering, gentle weight shifts. T6 itself can be attacked more than it looks, especially if you use a little curb. The trick is to keep some throttle in the car while you ride the inside—enough to keep the rear planted without turning the curb into a launch ramp.

- **Double right (T7/T8) and back straight**  
  This is your big momentum test. The double right sets up your speed for the kinked back straight. In the FF1600, think of it as one long, tightening right-hander: slow the car once, turn in cleanly, and then focus entirely on how early you can unwind the wheel and go to full throttle. Over-slow here and you stare at a sad delta for what feels like forever.

- **Turn 10 stop**  
  The heavy brake into T10 is Winton’s most obvious overtaking spot and its biggest “whoops” generator. The surface is never perfectly smooth, so straight-line the braking as much as you can, get most of your stopping done early, and accept that a slightly conservative entry pays back in exit drive and rear stability. In the Ray, a rushed, late brake here often leads to that classic “four wheels locked, no steering” moment.

- **Final sweeper (T11/12)**  
  The fast right-left at the end of the lap is where courage and finesse meet. The Ray likes a single, confident turn-in and a small lift rather than a full brake. Use all the track on exit, but only if the car is straight—grass waits immediately beyond the curb.

- **Brake bias & late-run behaviour**  
  A baseline around the low-50s keeps the nose planted into T3 and T10 when you’re learning. As you gain confidence (and tyre temp), nudging the bias a half-step rearward can help the car flick through the faster direction changes at the end of the lap without feeling lazy.

## Practice Cues for the Week

Let Winton be your **“hairpin honesty”** and **“exit discipline”** trainer in the Ray.

- **Two-hairpin parity drill**  
  Break the lap into T1–T6 for the first few sessions. Use your feel or telemetry to chase similar minimum speeds at T2 and T3 across multiple laps. If one hairpin is consistently slower, you’ve found your obvious homework.

- **Back-straight launch focus**  
  Dedicate a run where all you care about is the double right onto the back straight. Arrive a bit under the limit, experiment with different turn-in and throttle pick-up points, and feel which combination gives you the calmest, strongest pull. Everything else in the lap is secondary for that stint.

- **T10 racecraft rehearsal**  
  Use AI or ghost races to practise passes into T10 that are set up at least one corner in advance. Work on better exits from the back straight kink, early lane choice and firm-but-fair braking. No last-second lunges; Winton is narrow enough that “optimistic” quickly becomes “both in the paddock”.

Once Winton clicks in the FF1600, it stops feeling like an endless chore around a clothesline and starts feeling like a tight, satisfying puzzle: solve the hairpins, respect the bumps, protect your exits, and the lap time comes to you.
