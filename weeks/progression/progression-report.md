## 📈 Little Padawan's Progression Summary

Master Lonn! *_bows with scroll of charts_*

Welcome to your **Season Progression Tracker**! 📊

Right now, this is your **baseline** - Week 01 at Summit Point Jefferson. Think of this as the "before" photo in a transformation story. One data point. One snapshot. But what a snapshot it is!

**Your Week 01 Position:**
- **iRating:** 1377 (started at 1238, jumped +139!)
- **Position:** 749 out of 8,977 drivers (Top 8.3%)
- **Points Percentile:** 92nd (crushing it!)
- **iRating Percentile:** 66th (will catch up!)

The charts below show single points right now, but here's the magic: After Week 02 at Rudskogen, these will show TRENDS. Lines connecting the dots. Momentum. Direction. The story of your season unfolding week by week!

**What to watch for when Week 02 data arrives:**
- Is your iRating climbing steadily or in big jumps?
- Are you gaining positions consistently?
- Are your percentile gaps closing (results vs rating)?
- What's your trajectory? Accelerating? Steady? Plateauing?

For now, let's establish the baseline! 🏁

## 📊 Visual Progression

### iRating Journey

![iRating Progression](assets/irating_progression.png)

- **Starting iRating:** 1377
- **Current iRating:** 1377
- **Total Gain:** +0 points _(Week 01 baseline)_
- **Average per Week:** +0.0 points _(single week, no trend yet)_

**What this chart will show (Week 02+):** Your iRating climb week-over-week. We'll see if you're gaining consistently, accelerating, or plateauing. The trend line will tell the story of your season!

**Context:** You started the season at 1238 iRating and jumped to 1377 in Week 01 (+139 points!). That's a HUGE first-week gain from your victory and podium. Week 02 will show if you can maintain that momentum or if Week 01 was the "easy climb" before the real grind begins.

### Position Climb

![Position Climb](assets/position_climb.png)

- **Starting Position:** 749 _(out of 8,977 drivers!)_
- **Current Position:** 749
- **Positions Gained:** +0 _(Week 01 baseline)_

**Reading this chart:** Lower position = better = higher on the chart (Y-axis is inverted). The green shaded area shows how many drivers you're beating. Right now: **8,228 drivers** behind you! As you climb the standings, this green area will grow and we'll see your position number drop toward the elite top 100.

**What to expect:** As more drivers participate in Week 02, the total field will grow. You might see your absolute position number INCREASE even if your percentile stays the same (more drivers = more competition). Focus on percentile, not just raw position!

### Percentile Rankings

![Percentile Progression](assets/percentile_progression.png)

**Your Week 01 Percentiles:**
- 📊 **Points:** 92nd percentile (crushing it!)
- 🏆 **Wins:** 93rd percentile (elite!)
- 🏁 **Poles:** 93rd percentile (top qualifier!)
- ⭐ **iRating:** 66th percentile (will catch up!)

**What this chart tracks:** How you rank across 4 key metrics compared to ALL 8,977 drivers. Higher = better. The reference lines (50th, 75th, 90th percentile) show milestone tiers. Notice how your results (points/wins/poles at 92-93%) are WAY above your iRating (66%)? That gap will close as you race more - your rating will catch up to your performance!

**The Performance Gap:** You're outperforming your skill rating by **26+ percentiles**. Translation: The system hasn't caught up to how fast you actually are yet. Week 02 will start narrowing that gap as your iRating catches up to your results!

## 📊 Week-by-Week Breakdown

### Week 01: Summit Point Jefferson Circuit 🏁

- **Position:** 749 / 8,977 (Top 8.3%)
- **iRating:** 1377 (+139 from starting 1238!)
- **Points:** 80.0 (92nd percentile ⭐)
- **Wins:** 1 (93rd percentile 🏆)
- **Poles:** 1 (93rd percentile 🎯)
- **Starts:** 2 races
- **Incidents/Start:** 3.50 (53% cleaner than series avg 7.44!)

**Week 01 Story:**

Master Lonn arrived at Summit Point Jefferson on December 11 running **51.438s** and feeling completely lost. Brand new track. No white lines marking the edges. Just dotted center lines and pure instinct.

Seven days later? **50.592s**. Two podiums (🏆 P1 Victory + 🥉 P3). And something more valuable than lap times: **unbreakable confidence**.

The breakthrough came on December 13 when he discovered "Confident but Patient" - the mental state between scared and reckless. From there, the week became a masterclass in finding flow state. The December 14 AI race delivered **0.36s consistency (σ)** - metronome precision. The December 16 real race delivered his **first victory** with 0.70s consistency.

Then came the ultimate test: December 17, started from pole, spun, crashed, pitted for repairs, and still fought back to **P3** with a new PB of **50.592s**.

**The Numbers:**
- 3 PBs set (50.985s practice, 50.913s race, 50.592s race)
- Consistency evolution: 5.71s → 0.36s (flow state achieved)
- iRating jump: 1238 → 1377 (+139 points!)
- Elite incident rate: 3.5 vs series average 7.44

**What it means:** Week 01 wasn't just about getting faster. It was about discovering flow state, building confidence, and proving that resilience matters more than perfection. The foundation is SOLID. 🚀

## 💬 What These Visualizations Mean

**Single Week Data (Week 01):**

Right now you're seeing a snapshot - one data point representing where you are after Jefferson. Think of this as your "before" photo in a fitness transformation! 💪

**Coming Soon (Week 02+):**

Once you add Rudskogen data, these charts will show:
- **Trends:** Are you climbing steadily or in big jumps?
- **Momentum:** Accelerating improvement or plateauing?
- **Consistency:** Smooth progression or volatile swings?
- **Gaps:** Which metrics lag behind (needs focus)?

**How to Use Them:**
- Upload Week 02 standings after Rudskogen
- Run the progression tool again with both weeks
- Compare: Did you gain iRating? Climb positions? Improve percentiles?
- Identify patterns and set realistic goals based on YOUR actual trajectory

## 🎯 Next Steps: Week 02 at Rudskogen

**After Week 02 completes:**

1. **Download standings CSV** from iRacing (after week officially ends)
2. **Run:** `/analyze-standings-for-week 02`
3. **Generate progression charts:**
   ```bash
   uv run python tools/coach/visualize_standings_progression.py \
       data/standings/week01 \
       data/standings/week02
   ```
4. **Update this report** using `/update-progression-report`

**What to watch for in Week 02:**

- **iRating:** Will it continue climbing? Target: 1400+ (need +23 more)
- **Position:** Can you break into top 700? (need to beat 49+ drivers)
- **Percentile gaps:** Will your iRating percentile catch up to your results percentile?
- **Consistency:** Can you maintain Week 01's flow state at a NEW track?

**The Rudskogen Challenge:**

Week 02 is the real test. Jefferson was about building confidence and finding flow. Rudskogen is about **transferring** that confidence to unfamiliar territory. Can you apply the "Confident but Patient" mindset to a track with scary blind crests and technical sections?

The progression charts will tell the story. Are you:
- 🚀 **Accelerating** (bigger gains in Week 02)
- 📈 **Steady** (consistent improvement)
- 📊 **Plateauing** (Week 01 was the easy climb, now comes the grind)

**Prediction based on Week 01 trajectory:**

If you maintain Week 01's momentum (2 races, similar results), expect:
- iRating: ~1400-1450 (+23 to +73)
- Position: ~650-700 (climbing 50-100 spots)
- Points: Another 60-80 points

But here's the thing, Master: Week 02 is a HARDER track. So even maintaining your position would be impressive. Any climb? That's GROWTH.
