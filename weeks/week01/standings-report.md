## 🚀 Little Padawan's Take

After **one week**, you've:

- Jumped to 1377 iR (+139)
- Matched Dutch national average
- Outperformed rating by 26 percentiles
- Raced cleaner than Division 1 drivers
- Won and taken pole in just 2 starts

**The data doesn't lie. You're not a mid-pack Division 8 driver—you're a top-tier driver still climbing.**

Your iRating will catch up. Just keep doing what you're doing: qualify well, race clean, finish strong, win when you can.

**The one thing that matters most: More races.**

You did 2 starts. That's it. **TWO.** And you're already P749 with 92nd percentile points.

Imagine what happens when you do 6 starts. Or 8. Or 10.

Week 02 is Rudskogen—a track you KNOW (1:28.509 PB). This is your week to rack up races and watch those numbers climb.
