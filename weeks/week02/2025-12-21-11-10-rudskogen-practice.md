## Current Focus and Goal

**Focus**: Testing track limits and finding maximum pace  
**Goal**: Beat July PB ✅, then work on consistency in afternoon session

## The Story

Master Lonn went hunting for the limit. Not consistency, not clean laps—just the edge. With brake bias at 56.5%, he pushed every corner, found every track edge, racked up 9 incidents... and set a lap **0.397s faster than July**.

The breakthrough? The downhill doesn't scare him anymore. "Just a tad brake on entry and very light trail braking throughout," he said. And that long corner to the uphill? "I get on the gas way before the apex—as soon as I'm turned in."

**Master Lonn's Take**:
> "Well I was testing the track limit and drove as much as possible on the limit too, so a lot of off tracks. I will strive for consistency in the next session this afternoon. But I feel confident I can get rhythm and flow if I commit. The downhill feels less dangerous now (just a tad break on entry and very light trail braking throughout the long corner to the uphill part, where I get on the gass way before the apex (as soon as I'm turned in)."

**Little Wan's Take**:

1:28.572. Faster than July by 0.4s. Gap to theoretical? 0.123s. Two corners.

You found the pace by trusting the downhill and applying throttle early. The data shows it: +0.193g acceleration, +0.323g lateral grip, smoother inputs despite pushing harder. You spent 5.4% less time braking and gained 0.4s. That's not luck—that's technique.

The afternoon session? Add rhythm. You've got the pace. Now make it repeatable.

### G-Force Analysis

| Metric | Dec 21 | July | Δ | Meaning |
|--------|--------|------|---|---------|
| Max Braking G | -1.688g | -1.569g | -0.119g | Braking harder (56.5% bias working) |
| **Max Accel G** | **0.933g** | **0.740g** | **+0.193g** | Early throttle = more drive |
| **Max Lateral G** | **2.594g** | **2.271g** | **+0.323g** | Using more tire grip |
| Avg Lateral G | 0.811g | 0.773g | +0.039g | Higher cornering commitment |
| Long G Smoothness | 0.345 | 0.382 | -0.037 | Smoother inputs |
| Max Total G | 2.647g | 2.272g | +0.375g | Loading tires more = faster |

Early throttle + cornering commitment = 14% more grip.

### Braking Analysis

| Metric | Dec 21 | July | Δ |
|--------|--------|------|---|
| Time Braking | 17.7% | 23.1% | -5.4% |
| Max Brake Pressure | 0.949 | 0.789 | +0.160 |
| Brake Zones | 8 | 6 | +2 |

Braking harder for less time = confidence.

---

### Throttle Analysis

| Metric | Dec 21 | July | Δ |
|--------|--------|------|---|
| Full Throttle % | 59.2% | 62.7% | -3.5% |
| Avg Throttle | 0.676 | 0.686 | -0.009 |

Less time at full throttle but faster. Why? Throttle earlier in corners = better exits = higher average speed.

---

### Overdriving Indicators

| Metric | Dec 21 | July | Verdict |
|--------|--------|------|---------|
| Avg Steering Angle | 0.262 | 0.263 | Identical |
| Max Steering Angle | 1.235 | 1.356 | -0.121 (better) |
| Steering Smoothness | 0.276 | 0.284 | -0.008 (better) |
| Steering Efficiency | 7.50 | 6.52 | +0.97 (better) |
| Overdriving % | 17.2% | - | Low |
| Better Technique % | 23.0% | - | High |

More grip per degree of steering = efficiency. Less max steering = smoother. Faster and cleaner.

## 🗺️ Where Did You Find 0.397s?

### Winning Zones

**10% lap** (T1-T2): +6.3 km/h. Late braking, carrying more speed.  
**40% lap**: +3.5 km/h. More commitment, using the tires.  
**50% lap** (uphill exit): +4.7 km/h. Full throttle vs 77% = early throttle working.  
**80% lap**: +3.4 km/h. More confidence, more grip.  
**90% lap** (final corner): +4.3 km/h. Earlier throttle application again.

### Problem Zone

**77% lap** (S3): -9.7 km/h. Inconsistent S3 (σ = 0.700s). Expected in limit-testing session—you gained 0.4s overall by nailing the other zones.

## 🎓 Coaching

### What to Keep

1. **Early throttle application** — At 50% lap: full throttle vs 77% = +4.7 km/h. At 90% lap: 94% vs 1% = +4.3 km/h. Keep doing this.
2. **Late braking confidence** — 10% lap: braking 0.523g harder = +6.3 km/h. Spending 5.4% less time braking overall.
3. **Cornering commitment** — +0.323g more lateral grip used. Better steering efficiency (7.50 vs 6.52). Driving smoother while going faster.

### What to Fix

**S3 Consistency** (σ = 0.700s, loss/lap = 0.465s)
- Best: 15.921s
- Average: 16.386s
- Gap: 0.465s

Stop testing limits in S3. Find your 95% line and repeat it.

**Drill**:
1. Pick a reference speed for S3 entry (e.g., 180 km/h)
2. Hit that speed ±2 km/h for 5 laps in a row
3. Then push 2 km/h faster

### Afternoon Session Goal

**Consistency Target**: σ < 0.60s (down from 1.082s)

**How to Get There**:
1. Keep your early throttle technique (working)
2. Keep your late braking confidence (working)
3. Dial back S3 by 5% (find repeatable line)
4. Goal lap time: 1:28.8 - 1:29.2 range, every lap in that window

If you can hit 10 clean laps between 1:28.8 - 1:29.2 with σ < 0.60s, you'll be race-ready at a pace 0.5s faster than July.

**Race Week Goal**:
- Race pace: 1:29.0 ± 0.3s
- Consistency: σ < 0.50s
- Clean laps: 90%+

You have the pace. Now make it repeatable.
