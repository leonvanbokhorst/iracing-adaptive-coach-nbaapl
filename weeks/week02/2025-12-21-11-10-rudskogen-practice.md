## Current Focus and Goal

**Focus**: Testing track limits and finding maximum pace  
**Goal**: Beat July PB ✅, then work on consistency in afternoon session

---

## The Narrative

Master Lonn went hunting. Not for consistency, not for clean laps—for the **LIMIT**. And he found it.

With brake bias bumped to 56.5%, he pushed every corner, found every track edge, racked up 9 incidents... and set a lap that was **0.397s faster than his July PB**.

The breakthrough? **The downhill doesn't scare him anymore.** "Just a tad brake on entry and very light trail braking throughout," he said. And that long corner to the uphill? "I get on the gas way before the apex—as soon as I'm turned in."

This is what confidence looks like. This is what "finding the edge" delivers. Now he knows where the limit is. Next session? Dial it back 5%, add consistency, and the lap times will drop even further.

---

## 🏎️ The Vibe Check

**Master Lonn's Take**:
> "Well I was testing the track limit and drove as much as possible on the limit too, so a lot of off tracks. I will strive for consistency in the next session this afternoon. But I feel confident I can get rhythm and flow if I commit. The downhill feels less dangerous now (just a tad break on entry and very light trail braking throughout the long corner to the uphill part, where I get on the gass way before the apex (as soon as I'm turned in)."

**Little Wan's Take**:

MASTER! 🔥🔥🔥

You didn't just beat your July PB—you DEMOLISHED it by nearly 0.4 seconds! And you know what makes this even better? **YOU'RE RIGHT THERE AT YOUR THEORETICAL OPTIMAL!**

Gap to theoretical best: **0.123s**. That's TWO corners. You're not leaving time on the table anymore—you're EXTRACTING IT.

Look at these numbers:
- **+0.193g more acceleration** (that early throttle is WORKING!)
- **+0.323g more lateral grip** (you're using the tires!)
- **Smoother longitudinal G** (better car control)
- **Better steering efficiency** (7.50 vs 6.52)

You spent 5.4% LESS time braking and gained 0.4s. That's not luck. That's confidence + technique.

The afternoon session? Just add rhythm. You've found the pace. Now make it repeatable. 🎯

### Speed Comparison

| Metric | Dec 21 (NEW PB) | July PB | Difference |
|--------|-----------------|---------|------------|
| **Top Speed** | 197.3 km/h | 197.0 km/h | +0.4 km/h |
| **Average Speed** | 136.0 km/h | 135.0 km/h | **+1.0 km/h** |

### G-Force Analysis: The Real Story

| Metric | Dec 21 (NEW PB) | July PB | Difference | What It Means |
|--------|-----------------|---------|------------|---------------|
| **Max Braking G** | -1.688g | -1.569g | **-0.119g** | Braking harder (56.5% bias working) |
| **Max Accel G** | 0.933g | 0.740g | **+0.193g** | 🚀 Early throttle = MORE DRIVE! |
| **Max Lateral G** | 2.594g | 2.271g | **+0.323g** | Using MORE tire grip |
| **Avg Lateral G** | 0.811g | 0.773g | +0.039g | Higher cornering commitment overall |
| **Long G Smoothness** | 0.345 | 0.382 | **-0.037** | Smoother inputs (BETTER!) |
| **Max Total G** | 2.647g | 2.272g | **+0.375g** | Loading tires MORE = faster |

**🔥 The Breakthrough in Numbers**:
- **+0.193g acceleration**: Your "early throttle before apex" technique is delivering 26% more acceleration force!
- **+0.323g lateral**: You're using 14% more cornering grip than July.
- **Smoother**: Better car control despite pushing harder.

### Braking Analysis

| Metric | Dec 21 | July | Difference |
|--------|--------|------|------------|
| **Time Braking** | 17.7% | 23.1% | **-5.4%** |
| **Max Brake Pressure** | 0.949 | 0.789 | +0.160 |
| **Brake Zones** | 8 | 6 | +2 |

**Translation**: You're braking HARDER but for LESS TIME. That's the hallmark of confidence and late braking.

---

### Throttle Analysis

| Metric | Dec 21 | July | Difference |
|--------|--------|------|------------|
| **Full Throttle %** | 59.2% | 62.7% | -3.5% |
| **Avg Throttle** | 0.676 | 0.686 | -0.009 |

**What This Means**: You're spending LESS time at full throttle but going FASTER. Why? Because you're applying throttle earlier in corners (partial throttle earlier = better exits = higher average speed).

---

### Overdriving Indicators

| Metric | Dec 21 | July | Verdict |
|--------|--------|------|---------|
| **Avg Steering Angle** | 0.262 | 0.263 | Identical |
| **Max Steering Angle** | 1.235 | 1.356 | **-0.121 (BETTER!)** |
| **Steering Smoothness** | 0.276 | 0.284 | **-0.008 (BETTER!)** |
| **Steering Efficiency** | 7.50 | 6.52 | **+0.97 (BETTER!)** |
| **Overdriving %** | 17.2% | - | Low |
| **Better Technique %** | 23.0% | - | High |

**🎯 The Verdict**: Your technique has IMPROVED! More grip per degree of steering = efficiency. Less max steering = smoother. You're faster AND cleaner.

**1. 10% Lap Distance - Early Lap Exit (Likely T1-T2 transition)**
- Speed: **+6.3 km/h** faster (153.1 vs 146.8)
- Braking: Harder brake pressure (0.917 vs 0.762)
- Long G: **-0.523g more braking!**
- What happened: Late braking into T2, carrying more speed.

**2. 40% Lap Distance - Mid-Lap Corner Entry**

- Lat G: **+0.333g more!** (1.551g vs 1.218g)
- What happened: More commitment, using the tires.

**3. 50% Lap Distance - Uphill Exit (YOUR BREAKTHROUGH!)**
- Speed: **+4.7 km/h** faster (123.6 vs 119.0)
- Throttle: **FULL** vs 77% (early throttle working!)
- Accel G: 0.358g vs 0.350g
- What happened: **"I get on the gas way before the apex"** = THIS IS IT!

**4. 80% Lap Distance - High-Speed Corner**
- Speed: **+3.4 km/h** faster
- Lat G: +0.129g more
- What happened: More confidence, more grip.

**5. 90% Lap Distance - Final Corner Exit**
- Speed: **+4.3 km/h** faster
- Throttle: 94% vs 1% (!!)
- Long G: **+0.570g more acceleration!**

---

### 🔴 **Problem Zone** (Where You Lost Time)

**77% Lap Distance - High-Speed Section (S3)**
- Speed: **-9.7 km/h** slower (81.5 vs 91.2)
- Lat G: -1.542g LESS! (max loss point)
- What happened: Inconsistent S3 (σ = 0.700s). This is where you were testing limits and finding the edge.

**Note**: This is EXPECTED in a limit-testing session. You gained 0.4s overall because you NAILED the other zones.

---

## 🎓 Little Wan's Coaching

### ✅ **What to KEEP for Afternoon Session**

1. **Early Throttle Application**
   - At 50% lap (uphill exit): Full throttle vs 77% = +4.7 km/h gain
   - At 90% lap (final corner): 94% vs 1% = +4.3 km/h gain
   - **Keep doing this!** It's your secret weapon.

2. **Late Braking Confidence**
   - 10% lap: Braking 0.523g harder = +6.3 km/h gain
   - Spending 5.4% less time braking overall
   - **Keep this aggressive entry!**

3. **Cornering Commitment**
   - +0.323g more lateral grip used
   - Better steering efficiency (7.50 vs 6.52)
   - **You're driving SMOOTHER while going FASTER.**

---

### 🎯 **What to FIX for Afternoon Session**

**S3 Consistency** (σ = 0.700s, loss/lap = 0.465s)
- Best: 15.921s
- Average: 16.386s
- **Gap**: 0.465s

**The Plan**: Stop testing limits in S3. Find your 95% line and repeat it.

**Drill**:
1. Pick a reference speed for S3 entry (e.g., 180 km/h)
2. Hit that speed ±2 km/h for 5 laps in a row
3. THEN push 2 km/h faster

---

### 📈 **Afternoon Session Goal**

**Consistency Target**: σ < 0.60s (down from 1.082s)

**How to Get There**:
1. **Keep** your early throttle technique (working!)
2. **Keep** your late braking confidence (working!)
3. **Dial back S3** by 5% (find repeatable line)
4. **Goal lap time**: 1:28.8 - 1:29.2 range, but EVERY lap in that window

If you can hit 10 clean laps between 1:28.8 - 1:29.2 with σ < 0.60s?

**You'll be race-ready at a pace 0.5s faster than July.** That's a WEAPON.
