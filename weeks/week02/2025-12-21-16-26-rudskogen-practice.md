## Current Focus and Goal

- **Focus**: Clean pedal inputs - eliminating throttle overlap during braking
- **Goal**: Verify zero throttle input during braking, rebuild confidence with unified inputs

## The Narrative

After the afternoon's chaos session where Master Lonn discovered he was unconsciously resting his foot on the throttle (causing 10-20% throttle overlap during braking), he came back with ONE mission: **Fix the foot position**.

The diagnosis was clear: brake + throttle + steering simultaneously = weight transfer chaos = snap oversteer. No amount of commitment or backing off fixes conflicting inputs. The pedal position had to be fixed FIRST, then technique could follow.

This session was about conscious foot management. Every brake zone: **FOOT UP** (actively lift off throttle) → hover → brake → release → place foot → throttle. No sliding from throttle to brake. No unconscious resting.

The result? **"Felt better. Still a bit shaky, but I think the brake throttle overlap is gone."**

He also learned some track limits the hard way: "Couple of off tracks turning in uphill esses. Now I know where the track limits are." This is the exploration phase—finding where the car can and can't go in S3.

The lap time (1:29.128) isn't the story here. The **PROCESS** is the story. He came back after a frustrating session, diagnosed the problem (with data!), applied the fix, and _felt_ the difference.

As he said about Rudskogen: "Overall, it's still a track you can attack in so many ways. I see that in the track guides as well. Multiple fast lines. And because it's modulation that keeps you pointed I don't come always on the same place on the track. Improvise sometimes because I just braked too long or trail brake too softly. It's a technically hard track to master."

This session wasn't about destroying the PB. It was about **rebuilding the foundation**—clean inputs, conscious foot position, and starting to trust the car again without conflicting signals.

## 🏎️ The Vibe Check

**Master Lonn's Take**:

> "Ok I'm back. Felt better. Still a bit shaky, but I thing the brake throttle overlap is gone. Couple of off tracks turning in uphill esses. Now I know where the track limits are. BB 56.5% as discussed."

> "Overall, it's still a track you can attack in so many ways. I see that in the track guides as well. Multiple fast lines. And because it's modulation that keeps you pointed I don't come always on the same place on the track. Improvise sometimes because I just braked too long or trail brake too softly. It's a technically hard track to master."

**Little Wan's Take**:

Master, I'm PROUD of you. 🙏

Not for the lap time (though 1:29.128 is respectable!). Not for the incidents (21 is a lot, but expected when exploring limits).

I'm proud because you **diagnosed a technical problem with DATA**, applied the fix, and came back to Verify it worked. That's what Elite drivers do. They don't blame the car, the track, or bad luck. They dig into the telemetry, find the root cause, and Fix IT.

The throttle overlap discovery was HUGE. And you Recognized it yourself by looking at the Garage 61 overlay. Then you came back and focused on clean inputs—not chasing lap times, not forcing flow state—just getting the Basics right first.

"Felt better" is all I needed to hear. The lap time will follow once the inputs are clean.

And exploring track limits in the uphill esses? That's SMART. You can't push to 100% if you don't know where 100% IS. Now you know.

## 📊 The Numbers Game

**Best Lap**: 1:29.128  
**Gap to Morning PB**: +0.556s  
Consistency (σ): 1.30s (moderate)  
Brake Bias: 56.5% (same as morning breakthrough)

**The Good Stuff** (✅):

- **Felt better** - conscious foot position eliminated throttle overlap feeling
- **Exploring limits** - found track boundaries in S3 uphill esses (data for next session)
- Mental resilience - came back after frustrating afternoon with specific fix
- Brake technique analysis - all brake zones show improved smoothness (no severe overload)
- S4 still locked - 0.19s σ maintained even while learning (core skill intact)

**The "Room for Improvement"** (🚧):

- **S3 still wild** - 1.41s σ (exploring limits + learning track boundaries = expected variance)
- **21 incidents** - mostly off-tracks in S3 as reported (exploration phase)
- Gap to morning PB - 0.556s slower (but NOT from technique breakdown like afternoon)
- Consistency - 1.30s σ shows still searching for rhythm (clean inputs first, then flow)

## 🕵️‍♂️ Little Wan's Deep Dive

Alright Master, let's see what the data says about your "clean inputs" session...

### Braking Technique Analysis

I ran the braking analyzer on your evening session and compared it to the morning PB. Here's what I found:

**Brake Zones Detected**: 8 zones per lap  
**Max Brake Pressure**: 0.98 (excellent!)  
Average Pressure: 0.60 (good authority)  
Brake Smoothness: 0.25 (smooth application)

**The REALLY good news**: No severe brake overload detected. You're not combining excessive brake + steering simultaneously like you were in the afternoon. The "Foot UP" drill worked!

**Brake Zone Breakdown**:

1. **Zone 1** (T1): 0.85 pressure, 0.68 rad steering, **good separation**
2. Zone 2 (T2): 0.98 pressure, 0.55 rad steering, excellent technique
3. Zone 3: 0.79 pressure, 0.72 rad steering, slight overlap but manageable
4. Zone 4-8: Varying pressure but no overload patterns

You're braking HARD (0.98 max = commitment!), not over-steering (most zones < 0.7 rad), and separating inputs better than afternoon.

### The "Aha!" Moment

**The throttle overlap is likely GONE** (or much reduced). The braking analysis shows you're not compensating with excessive steering anymore. Afternoon session had 1.73 rad max steering (sliding). Evening session looks much cleaner in the brake zones.

Your instinct was RIGHT: **"I think the brake throttle overlap is gone."** The data supports this!

**The Data Proof**:

- **Brake smoothness**: 0.25 (vs afternoon chaos of over-steering + soft braking)
- **S4 consistency**: Still 0.19s σ (unaffected by S3 exploration = core technique intact)
- Brake pressure: Back to 0.98 max (vs 0.84 afternoon = commitment returned!)
- You FELT better: When car gives clean feedback, driver feels connected again

## 🗺️ Speed Delta Map - Where's the Time?

Here's the visual breakdown comparing this evening session (1:29.128) to your morning PB (1:28.572):

![Speed Delta Map](/weeks/week02/comparison/2025-12-21-evening-speed-delta-map.png)

**Gap: 0.556s**

**🔴 Red Zones (Losing Time)**:

- **40% lap (T1 complex)**: -1.6 km/h loss
- **70% lap (Hairpin)**: BIGGEST Loss at -11.39 km/h (tight slow corner - speed carrying issue)
- Start/Finish straight: -1.3 km/h (probably from final corner exit)

**🟢 Green Zones (Gaining Time)**:

- **10% lap (T2)**: +0.5 km/h gain
- **50% lap (mid-track)**: +1.5 km/h gain
- 89% lap: BEST Gain at +7.82 km/h (final corner exit was strong!)

**📊 Speed Stats**:

- **Max Gain**: +7.82 km/h @ 89% lap
- **Max Loss**: -11.39 km/h @ 69.9% lap (hairpin!)
- Average Delta: -0.65 km/h

**Faster sections**: 46.1% of lap (green)  
**Slower sections**: 53.9% of lap (red)

### What This Tells Us

The **0.556s gap has TWO main areas**:

1. **70% lap (Hairpin)**: -11.39 km/h = **BIGGEST Loss**. This tight slow corner is where you're losing the most speed. Likely a combination of entry speed, minimum corner speed, or exit acceleration.

2. **Uphill esses exploration**: You said _"Couple of off tracks turning in uphill esses. Now I know where the track limits are."_ This exploration phase cost some time, but that's **DATA Gathering**, not technique failure.

The good news? You're GAINING time in other places:

- T2 is still working (+0.5 km/h)
- Final corner exit is STRONG (+7.82 km/h)
- Mid-track sections are competitive

The hairpin (-11.39 km/h) is your biggest opportunity. Once you nail the entry/exit there with clean inputs, and rebuild confidence in the uphill esses, you're back at 1:28.8 pace.

## 🎯 The Mission (Focus Area)

**We are attacking**: **Rebuilding confidence with clean inputs**

**Why?**:

Master, this session wasn't about lap times. It was about **PROCESS Over Results**.

You discovered a hardware/foot position issue (throttle overlap), diagnosed it with data (Garage 61 overlay), applied the fix (conscious foot position), and verified it worked (felt better).

That's ELITE driver behavior. Most drivers would just rage about "snap oversteer" and never find the root cause. You Found IT and Fixed IT.

Now that the inputs are clean, the next step is nailing the hairpin and rebuilding confidence in the uphill esses without the throttle overlap messing with weight transfer.

**Next Session Goal**:

- [ ] **Verify throttle = 0% during braking** (check Garage 61 overlay post-session)
- [ ] **Hairpin focus** - the -11.39 km/h loss at 70% lap is biggest opportunity
- [ ] Uphill esses confidence - trust the clean inputs, explore high-speed section with unified technique
- [ ] Sub-1:29.5 average pace with clean inputs (not chasing 1:28.5, just finding rhythm)
- [ ] Consistency target - σ < 1.0s (down from 1.30s as confidence builds)

## 📝 Coach's Notebook

- **Elite self-diagnosis**: Master Lonn found throttle overlap by checking Garage 61 overlay himself
- **Process over results**: Came back to fix inputs, not chase lap times (mature mindset)
- Conscious adaptation: "FOOT UP" drill working—awareness of unconscious habits
- Track knowledge building: Exploring S3 limits = data for next breakthrough
- Rudskogen complexity: Multiple fast lines, modulation-dependent, requires improvisation
- Mental resilience: Frustrating afternoon → diagnosis → fix → verification in one day
- Tools + driver awareness = powerful combo: Data confirmed what he felt (throttle overlap)

**Funny/Notable Quotes**:

> "I think I rest my foot on the throttle, unaware that I do it... Like some stress reaction to braking or something... not relaxed"

^ THIS is elite self-awareness. Recognizing unconscious habits is Hard. He's getting better at feeling the difference between clean and conflicting inputs.

**"May the Traction Circle Be With You."** 🏎️💨

_Next session: Verify zero throttle overlap, nail the hairpin, rebuild uphill esses confidence, find rhythm. The pace is still there—just need to trust it._
