## 📍 TL;DR

Race PB: 1:28.508 (0.063s faster than practice). 57.5% brake bias felt more stable. Committed harder in race, braked harder, used more grip. Setup change critical. Next: Maintain race commitment, trust technique.

## The Smoking Gun: You Committed HARDER in the Race + Better Setup

Master Lonn went faster in the race by doing the OPPOSITE of "backing off." He committed More, braked Harder, used More grip, and trusted the technique under pressure.

**AND** he ran 57.5% brake bias (vs 56.5% in practice), which felt "way more stable." This setup change was Critical—more front bias enabled the harder braking and better technique that the telemetry reveals.

## 🔥 What Changed (The Good Stuff)

### 1. Braking: MASSIVELY More Aggressive

- **Max brake pressure**: 0.948 vs 0.761 practice = **+24.5% HARDER**
- Max braking G: -1.687g vs -1.436g = +17.5% more braking force
- Time spent braking: 17.7% vs 20.0% practice = -2.3% Less time braking
- Brake zones: 8 vs 6 = more brake applications but shorter duration
- Brake bias: 57.5% (race) vs 56.5% (practice) = +1.0% more front bias

**Translation**: Late braking + hard braking + confidence + BETTER BB = time gained. The 57.5% BB enabled him to brake 24.5% harder because more front bias = more weight transfer = more front grip = can actually Use that brake pressure. The Dec 21 lesson (brake Hard, not soft) was Internalized, and the setup now Supports it.

### 2. Cornering: Using MORE of the Tire

- **Max lateral G**: 2.593g vs 2.435g practice = **+6.5% MORE cornering force**
- Avg lateral G: 0.811g vs 0.782g = +3.7% more average grip used
- Max total G: 2.646g vs 2.440g = +8.4% more combined forces

**Translation**: Master Lonn was loading the tires PROPERLY in the race, using more of the available grip. This is what Dec 21 morning looked like—commitment creates grip.

### 3. Steering: MORE Input but Better Efficiency

- **Avg steering angle**: 0.262 rad vs 0.240 rad = +9% more steering
- **Max steering angle**: 1.234 rad vs 1.114 rad = +11% more steering
- Steering efficiency: 7.49 g/deg vs 6.24 g/deg = +20% BETTER efficiency!

**Translation**: This is WILD. He used More steering in the race but got More grip per degree of steering. That means the technique was Better, not worse. He was using steering correctly (smooth, deliberate) rather than backing off and sliding (Dec 21 afternoon chaos).

### 4. Overdriving: LESS in Race Than Practice!

- **Overdriving %**: 18.9% of lap (practice was worse)
- **Better technique %**: 21.7% of lap had better grip usage

**Translation**: Master Lonn was overdriving LESS under race pressure than in practice. The mental state in the race was Cleaner, more focused, less chaotic.

## 📍 Speed Deltas Around the Lap

| Lap % | Speed Diff     | What This Means                                 |
| ----- | -------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| 10%   | **+1.61 km/h** | Braking later/harder into corners               |
| 20%   | -0.29 km/h     | Similar mid-corner speed                        |
| 30%   | -0.25 km/h     | Similar                                         |
| 40%   | +0.03 km/h     | Even                                            |
| 50%   | **+0.64 km/h** | Better mid-corner speed, early throttle working |
| 60%   | -0.30 km/h     | Slight loss                                     |
| 70%   | -0.45 km/h     | Slight loss (hairpin area)                      |
| 80%   | **+0.96 km/h** | Better corner exit!                             |
| 90%   | **+0.45 km/h** | Carrying exit speed better                      |
| 100%  | -0.38 km/h     | Slight loss on main straight                    |

**Net result**: Gains in braking zones (10%), mid-lap (50%), and exits (80-90%) outweighed minor losses elsewhere.

## 🎯 The Breakthrough Insight

**Race pressure didn't make Master Lonn slow—it made him Better. And he had a BETTER Setup.**

When the race mattered (lap 7, recovering from lap 5 incident, feeling confident), he accessed a mental state AND setup that unlocked:

- **Commitment** (24% harder braking - enabled by 57.5% BB)
- **Trust** (6.5% more lateral G)
- Better technique (20% better steering efficiency)
- Less overdriving (18.9% vs higher in practice)
- Better setup (57.5% BB felt "way more stable")

This is EXACTLY the Dec 21 morning technique (early throttle, hard braking, commitment) but under race pressure With a setup that supports it better. The muscle memory stuck. The technique transferred. And the setup enhanced it.

**The BB Story**: Master Lonn was RIGHT on Dec 21 afternoon about needing 57% BB, but couldn't use it until throttle overlap was fixed (Dec 21 evening). With clean inputs + 57.5% BB = unlocked 0.064s! Perfect timing: fix foundation First (clean inputs), Then optimize setup (BB).

## 🧠 The Mental State Hypothesis

Lap 7 came after:

- Lap 5 disaster (S2 incident)
- Lap 6 recovery (89.557s)
- Lap 7 flow state (88.508s NEW PB)

The pattern: **Incident → Recovery → Flow** suggests Master Lonn found the mental reset mid-race. He didn't panic after lap 5—he REFOCUSED and went faster than ever.

But then lap 8 disaster → lap 9 spin suggests the second incident broke that mental state. The lesson: Can access flow after ONE incident, but Two incidents in close succession created mental spiral.

## 💡 Next Race Strategy

**What worked (lap 7)**:

- **57.5% brake bias** (KEEP This - it works!)
- Brake 24% harder (0.95 pressure zone - enabled by better BB)
- Use 6.5% more lateral grip (load those tires!)
- Trust the technique (steering efficiency was Better in race)
- Less overdriving under pressure (race focus > practice exploration)

**What to protect against (lap 8-9)**:

- Mental reset protocol: ONE incident = refocus and continue. Two incidents = survival lap to reset brain.
- S3 under mental pressure: High-speed section collapses when frustrated/urgent. Need calm even after mistakes.

**Setup testing**:

- **Next race: KEEP 57.5% BB** - don't change what delivered a PB
- **Practice session**: Consider testing 58% BB incrementally (57.5% → 58% → 58.5%) to see if there's more to gain
- Don't jump to 59% straight away - find the edge gradually, 57.5% is the proven baseline

**Bottom line**: Master Lonn went faster in the race by COMMITTING More + Better Setup, not backing off. The technique from Dec 21 morning breakthrough Works under pressure, and 57.5% BB enhances it. The spin on lap 9 wasn't from pushing too hard—it was from mental disruption after lap 8. The solution isn't caution or changing setup, it's mental reset protocols while keeping the setup that works.

**The Global Validation**: This race lap now ranks **505 / 2,179** globally (top 23.2%) at Rudskogen Ray FF1600 across an entire year. Master Lonn went from rusty (1:30.290, Dec 18) to top 500 globally (1:28.508, Dec 22) in 5 days. This isn't just a personal breakthrough—it's a competitive achievement. Faster than 1,674 drivers. Top quarter of the entire player base. The leaderboard doesn't lie.
