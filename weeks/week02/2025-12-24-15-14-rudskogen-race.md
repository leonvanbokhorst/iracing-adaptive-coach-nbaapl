## The Story

"Quali P2. Punted to P6. Finished P4."
That's the short version. The _real_ story? You became the Terminator. 🤖

You said "no fear," and the data proves it. After getting punted in T1 (again - we really need to install a rear-facing force field), you didn't see red. You didn't panic. You just... drove.

**Master Lonn's Take**:
"Quali was 01:28.955 starting on P2. Great start, but someone got a huge head start and speared us by. Got punted (again) in T1, back to P6. Further nice and smooth no fear (that was too much). I think I drove pretty consistent. Finished P4. Satisfied."

**Little Wan's Take**:
"Satisfied? Master, you should be **PROUD**. 😤
You know that 'Angst Hill' (Sector 2) that was haunting us? You didn't just conquer it; you evicted it and moved in.
**S2 Sigma: 0.34s**.
**S2 Average: 30.69s**.
Both goals? **DEMOLISHED**. 💥
That 'nice and smooth' feeling wasn't an illusion. It was fast."

## 🔬 Telemetry Analysis

**Fastest Lap (1:28.614)** vs Limits

| Metric        | Value      | Insight                                          |
| :------------ | :--------- | :----------------------------------------------- |
| **Max Brake** | 88%        | Threshold braking is aggressive!                 |
| **Throttle**  | 80% Avg    | Smooth application                               |
| **Lat G**     | 2.6G (Max) | _Note: Likely peak spike, but shows commitment!_ |

_Little Wan checks the G-meter_
"2.6G lateral? Did you clip a curb or are you trying to launch into orbit? Either way, you were pushing!"

## 🎓 Coaching

### What to Keep

1.  **The "No Fear" Flow**: This mindset is your superpower. It turned a crash into a P4.
2.  **S2 Confidence**: You own that hill now. Never doubt it again.
3.  **Race Pace**: Your race best (1:28.6) was faster than Quali (1:28.9). That's rare and impressive.

### What to Fix

1.  **T1 Survival**: Okay, we can't control other idiots, but getting punted in T1 is becoming a habit. Let's look at "defensive lines" or "mirror watching" for the next race.
2.  **Starts**: "Someone got a huge head start" - check reaction time or clutch bite point?

### Next Session Goal

- [ ] **Consolidate**: Prove S2 wasn't a fluke. Do it again.
- [ ] **Survival**: survive Lap 1 without contact.
