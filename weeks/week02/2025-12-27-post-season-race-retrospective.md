## The Story

I went back to Rudskogen. One more race. Not for points. Not for iRating. Just... because.

**The setup was perfect:**

- Qualified P5 in a 1531 SoF (Strength of Field) race
- Clean start → P4 on lap 1
- Two cars ahead started fighting each other
- Both went off track
- P2. Just like that.

**P1 was 5+ seconds away. Too far to catch. The race was for P2.**

And that's when the fear kicked in.

Not the competitive urge. Not the desire to catch P1. **Fear of losing P2.**

## What Happened: The Loop

**Lap 3, Sector 3 Left-Hander (on the hill):**

- Spin.
- P7.

My brain said: _"Don't let them pass. Hold the position. Don't mess up."_

My body responded with: tension, tight grip, overdrive.

The car said: _"No."_

**Lap 4, Same Corner, Same Spin:**

- Dead last.

My brain said: _"Don't spin here again. NOT HERE."_

What did I do? **Spun.**

The classic "Pink Elephant Problem": Don't think about spinning → Brain hears "SPIN."

## What I Realized

After the race, sitting there at P9/12, iRating -39, I wrote this:

> "It's not my pace, it's not my prep or my coach or my car or the others... most of the times it's me. And that can be fixed."

**The truth:**

- The field was well-behaved. Clean drivers. No stupid dive bombs. We gave each other space.
- The spins? All me. 2x incidents, both from my mistakes.
- The only damage was to my pride (and my iRating).

**The deeper truth:**

- Qualifying was 0.883s off my PB. I wasn't in flow state from the start.
- When P1 pulled away, I went into **defense mode** instead of **race mode**.
- It's not about wanting to overtake others. It's about **fear of being overtaken**.

## The Contract I Forgot

Remember Week 1? The agreement we made?

> **"I will focus on LEARNING over WINNING."**  
> **"I will treat every race as DATA, not DRAMA."**

I forgot it completely. Like it didn't exist.

The moment I was P2, my brain switched:

- ❌ Learning Mode: "This is a great race! Let's see how fast I can go."
- ✅ Fear Mode: "Don't lose this. Must hold position. Can't mess up."

**Fear makes you tight. Flow makes you fast.**

I was thinking with my... well, not my brain. Let's say that.

## The Lesson: "Meebewegen"

**Dutch word, no direct English translation. Closest: "Moving with" or "Going with the flow."**

When I'm racing scared, I'm **fighting the car**:

- Tight hands
- Tense shoulders
- Jerky inputs
- Overdriving

When I'm racing calm, I'm **dancing with the car**:

- Smooth inputs
- Trust in technique
- Letting it flow
- Meebewegen

**The problem:**

- In practice, I can practice meebewegen consciously
- In racing, when the pressure hits, I revert to **survival mode**
- Survival mode ≠ smooth
- Survival mode = fighting

**The fix:**
I need to practice meebewegen **under pressure**, so it becomes automatic.

Because when the race is on, my thinking brain shuts down. The **practiced brain** takes over.

And right now, my practiced brain under pressure is: "GRIP HARDER, FIGHT MORE, DON'T LOSE."

That needs to change.

## The Data Doesn't Lie

**Qualifying: 1:29.391**

- 0.883s off PB
- Pressure was there from the start
- Not in flow state

**Race craft before the spins:**

- Clean start
- P4 → P2 (brilliant)
- Field was respectful
- I was executing

**Race craft during the spins:**

- Same corner twice
- Not a car problem
- Not a setup problem
- **Mental loop problem**

**Race craft after the spins:**

- Still clean (no contact with others)
- SR +0.06 (maintained racecraft even while spinning)
- P9 finish (could've been worse with rage quits)

**The truth:**
The pace is there (1:29.391 is close to PB).  
The skill is there (racecraft to P2 was clean).  
The respect is there (2x incidents, no contact, SR +).

**What's missing:** The mental game.

## What Needs to Happen: The Practice Plan

### 1. **Reframe the Fear**

**Current mindset:**

> "Fear of being overtaken"

**New mindset:**

> "Curiosity about what they'll try"

When someone is behind me, they're not a threat. They're a **teacher**:

- Where are they faster?
- What line are they taking?
- Can I learn from them?

Make it a **game**, not a **threat**.

---

### 2. **Practice Pressure Situations: The "Let Them By" Drill**

**Next practice session at ANY track:**

1. Drive 5 laps at race pace
2. When someone catches me, **let them pass**
3. Follow them for 2-3 laps
4. Try to learn their line
5. **Don't try to re-pass**

**Goal:** Desensitize myself to being overtaken. Practice staying calm when someone is faster.

**Why it works:**
Being overtaken won't feel like "losing" anymore. It'll feel like "data collection."

---

### 3. **The "S3 Left-Hander" Ritual**

I spun twice in the **same corner**.

**Before the corner:**

- Breathe out (release tension)
- Say (in my head): "Smooth, not fast"
- Focus on **exit**, not entry

**In the corner:**

- Feel the weight transfer (meebewegen)
- Trust the car
- If it slides, **let it slide** (don't fight it)

**After the corner:**

- "Good" or "Learn" (no judgment)

---

### 4. **The Contract Reminder Card**

Literally write this on a sticky note and put it on my wheel base:

```
FOCUS: LEARNING
NOT: WINNING

FLOW > FEAR
```

Read it before EVERY race. Out loud. Once.

## What This Means

**This isn't failure. This is growth.**

Most drivers never reach this level of self-awareness. They blame:

- The car
- The track
- The netcode
- The other drivers
- Anything but themselves

I looked in the mirror and said: **"It was me."**

That's not weakness. That's **strength**.

**And here's the key:**

> "It can be fixed."

iRating comes back. Lap times come back. Positions come back.

But this lesson—this awareness—this stays.

**Next time I'm P2 in a race, I'll remember:**

- The speed is there (1:29.391 proves it)
- The skill is there (P4 → P2 proves it)
- The fear is just **untrained mental muscle**

And mental muscle can be trained. Just like braking points. Just like racing lines.

## The Honest Truth

Little Padawan asked me: _"Do we need to document this?"_

Yes.

Not because of the lap times. Not because of the telemetry.

Because **this is the breakthrough moment** where I discovered:

> "Most of the times it's me. And that can be fixed."

That's the lesson.

And that's worth writing down.

**Guidebook Connection:** This experience is now documented in Chapter 12 (Mental Game), Section on Fear Loops and Pressure Management.

**Next Action:** Practice the "Let Them By" drill at Winton before next race.
