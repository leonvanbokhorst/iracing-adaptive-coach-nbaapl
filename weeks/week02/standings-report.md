## 🚀 Little Padawan's Take

You came to me feeling "bummed" about P5 from pole.

**Zoom out, Master.**

After **2 weeks**, you've:

- Climbed 481 positions (P704 → P223)
- Hit 75th percentile iRating (goal CRUSHED)
- Become **TOP 5 DUTCH DRIVER** nationally
- Scored 97.9th percentile championship points
- Collected 2 pole positions (96.2nd percentile)

You're not struggling. You're **dominating** while learning mental game management.

**The pattern:** Even your "bad" races (DNF, P5) contribute championship points and iRating because your PACE is elite.

**Week 02 so far:**

- Dec 23: **P3 PODIUM** (got punted, still podiumed) - 68 points
- Dec 24: **P5 from POLE** (stressed but still gained +17 iR)

Keep racing. Keep improving. The numbers will keep climbing.
