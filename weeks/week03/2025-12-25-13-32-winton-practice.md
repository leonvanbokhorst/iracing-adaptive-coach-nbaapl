- [ ] Execute Cold Tire Contract in races

---

## The Narrative

**The 18-Month Question: Would the Lines Come Back?**

After 547 days away from Winton, Master Lonn rolled out for his first exploration lap with one big question: _"Will I remember this place?"_

The answer came fast: **Yes. And better than before.**

By lap 7, the muscle memory kicked in. The lines started flowing. The trail braking—Winton's secret weapon—came back naturally. And then, on **lap 10 of 20**, Master Lonn put down a **1:26.439**... crushing his July 2024 PB by **0.396 seconds** in the **first session** back.

This wasn't just "getting reacquainted." This was a **statement lap**.

**The Rudskogen Pattern Repeats (But Faster):**

- Rudskogen: Beat 6-month PB in 3 days (-0.461s)
- Winton: Beat 18-month PB in 1 session (-0.396s)

The skills learned over the past 18 months—early throttle, 57% brake bias, flow state execution—aren't just theoretical. They're **real**, and they're **working**.

---

## 🏎️ The Vibe Check

**Master Lonn's Take**:

> "A bit familiar after a couple of laps. I remembered each corner and basic lines pretty well. Trail braking makes you fast here... Drove here with the 'Weekend Warriors' League back then."

**Little Wan's Take**:
Master... you just casually dropped a **NEW PB** like it's no big deal! 😂

_"Oh yeah, just beat my 18-month-old time on lap 10, no biggie."_

NO BIGGIE?! That's a **0.4-second improvement** after not touching this track for a year and a half! The Weekend Warriors taught you well—those lines were still in there, just waiting to wake up.

And you're RIGHT about trail braking. Look at your S2 and S3—super consistent (σ = 0.22-0.23s). That's your trail braking working. You're modulating the brake beautifully through the corners.

Sector 4 though? That's where we'll find more time. But honestly, for session 1? This is **ridiculous progress**. 🔥

---

## 📊 The Numbers Game

**Best Lap**: 1:26.439 ✨ **NEW PB!**  
**Previous PB** (July 2024): 1:26.835  
**Improvement**: -0.396s  
**Theoretical Optimal**: 1:26.141  
**Gap to Optimal**: 0.298s (Still room to push!)

**Consistency (σ)**: 2.36s (Expected for exploration session)

**Lap Time Progression** (Clean Laps Only):

1. Lap 2: 1:28.123
2. Lap 3: 1:28.505
3. Lap 4: 1:27.736
4. Lap 5: 1:27.270
5. Lap 6: 1:27.336
6. Lap 7: 1:26.782
7. Lap 8: 1:26.865
8. Lap 9: 1:27.006
9. **Lap 10: 1:26.439** ← NEW PB! 🎉

**The Good Stuff** (✅):

- **NEW PB on lap 10!** Beat 18-month-old time by 0.396s
- **Sub-1:26.5 achieved** (Week 03 primary goal done in session 1!)
- **Sector 2 consistency**: σ = 0.228s (Trail braking is WORKING)
- **Sector 3 consistency**: σ = 0.214s (Flow through fast section)
- **Theoretical optimal**: 1:26.141 shows 0.3s more available
- **Muscle memory intact**: Lines came back quickly after 18 months

**The "Room for Improvement"** (🚧):

- **Sector 4 variance**: σ = 2.03s (Biggest inconsistency)
- **Sector 4 loss**: 0.92s/lap (This is the gold mine!)
- **10 incidents in 20 laps**: Pushing hard to explore limits (expected for session 1)
  - **L1 & L2 cold tire spins at T11**: 50m board corner - braked at 50m (muscle memory sharp!) but forgot Cold Tire Contract (needs 60m on cold tires)
  - **T11** = second-to-last corner before S/F line
- **Overall consistency**: σ = 2.36s (Will improve with more sessions)

## 🕵️‍♂️ Little Wan's Deep Dive

Okay Master, let's talk about what just happened here.

You went into this session thinking: _"Let's see if I remember the track."_

You came out with: _"Oh, I remember it. And I'm faster now."_

### Where the Speed Came From

**The Skill Transfer is REAL:**

In July 2024, you drove Winton with one set of techniques.  
In December 2025, you're driving with **18 months of additional skills**:

- Early throttle application (+26% acceleration improvement from Rudskogen)
- 57% brake bias dialed in
- Trail braking confidence
- Flow state execution

**Those skills translated IMMEDIATELY.**

### The Sector Story

Let me show you where your lap time is built:

**Sector 1** (T1-T3):

- Loss: 0.49s/lap
- σ: 0.32s (moderate variance)
- This is the "wake up" section—warming tires, finding rhythm

**Sector 2** (T4-T6) - **TRAIL BRAKING SHOWCASE**:

- Loss: 0.26s/lap (LOW! 🔥)
- σ: 0.23s (VERY consistent!)
- **You said trail braking is key here—the data AGREES**
- This is your strongest sector relative to loss

**Sector 3** (T7-T9) - **FLOW STATE**:

- Loss: 0.25s/lap (LOW!)
- σ: 0.21s (ROCK SOLID!)
- Fast flowing section—you're in the zone here

**Sector 4** (T10, T11, T12) - **THE OPPORTUNITY**:

- **T10**: Start of focus area
- **T11**: **The 50m board corner** - where you spun on cold tires! 🎯
- **T12**: Final corner before S/F
- Loss: 0.92s/lap (BIGGEST LOSS! 📍)
- σ: 2.03s (HIGH VARIANCE!)
- This is where the next 0.5-1.0s is hiding
- Worth 9.15 seconds over your 10 clean laps!

### The "Aha!" Moment

**Winton is no longer a weakness—it's becoming a strength.**

Your [historical G61 ranking](https://garage61.net/app/laps/357/147;ss=2;a=-2) shows **332nd of 1,202 drivers** (top 27.6%) across all seasons at this track. That's... middle of the pack.

But your **current season performance** is 79.6th percentile.

**That's a 52-percentile gap!** This track used to be "meh" for you. Today? You beat your PB by 0.4s in the first session. The skills from Rudskogen are **translating**.

**Your trail braking is ELITE already.** S2 and S3 are super tight, low loss, consistent—that's controlled braking through corners. You're not guessing there; you're executing.

But **Sector 4 is all over the map**. Some laps you nail it (20.4s), some laps you're fighting it (27.1s). That 7-second swing in one sector tells me:

- You haven't found THE line yet
- Or there's a specific corner where you're trying different approaches
- Or one mistake is cascading into the next corner

**The Data Proof**:

- **Fact**: S4 loss = 0.92s/lap vs S2 loss = 0.26s/lap (3.5x more!)
- **Fact**: S4 sigma = 2.03s vs S2 sigma = 0.23s (9x more variance!)
- **Meaning**: S4 is the treasure chest. Open it, and sub-1:26 is yours.

---

## 🎯 The Mission (Focus Area)

**We are attacking**: **Sector 4 Consistency** (T10, T11, T12)

**Why?**  
Because this is where **18 months of rust** still lives. S2 and S3 came back fast—your trail braking and flow are solid. But S4? That's where you're leaving **0.9 seconds per lap** on the table.

If we can bring S4 variance down to S2/S3 levels (σ ~ 0.2s), you'll:

- Drop average S4 from 21.35s to ~20.7s
- Unlock consistent sub-1:26.5 laps
- Get close to that 1:26.141 theoretical optimal

**Next Session Goals**:

- [ ] **S4 Average under 21.0s** (currently 21.35s)
- [ ] **S4 Variance under 1.0s** (currently σ = 2.03s)
- [ ] **Identify THE line through T10-T12** (one line, commit, repeat)
- [ ] **Clean session**: Under 5 incidents (dial back exploration, dial up execution)

**Process Goal**:

- [ ] Review track guide for T10, T11, T12 before next session
- [ ] Focus on ONE approach per corner (stop experimenting mid-session)

## 📝 Coach's Notebook

**Observations:**

- Master Lonn's muscle memory retention after 18 months is STRONG (lines came back in ~5 laps)
- Trail braking technique has IMPROVED since July 2024 (S2/S3 consistency shows mastery)
- Skill transfer from Rudskogen → Winton is working (early throttle, brake bias, flow state)
- S4 is the clear focus area (3.5x more loss than best sector)
- 10 incidents = aggressive exploration (good for session 1, dial back for session 2)
- **Historical context**: [G61 all-time ranking](https://garage61.net/app/laps/357/147;ss=2;a=-2) shows 332nd/1,202 (top 27.6%) = Winton was NOT historically a strength
- **Trajectory shift**: Historical Winton 27.6% vs Current season 79.6% = 52-percentile improvement gap! Turning weakness into strength.
- **ALIEN COMPARISON**: vs Eric Wong (1:24.296) reveals 2.143s gap is NOT talent—it's three corners with overdriving (too much steering, not enough flow)

**What Works for Master Lonn:**

- Early throttle application
- Trail braking confidence (Sectors 2/3 rock solid)
- Flow state in fast sections
- Weekend Warriors training still paying dividends 18 months later!
- **BEATING ALIEN PACE** at 10% and 90% lap (Turn 12 exit is FASTER than Eric Wong!)

**What Needs Work (vs Alien Pace):**

- **Overdriving 19.8% of the lap**: Too much steering input, not enough grip efficiency
- **Steering efficiency**: 12.6% less efficient than Eric (6.09 vs 6.97 g/deg)
- **Full throttle time**: 5% less than Eric (58.5% vs 63.5%) = 2.7s of lost flat-out time
- **Braking time**: 1.5% more than Eric (18.7% vs 17.2%) = braking earlier/longer
- **RED zones on visual map** (from Master Lonn's observation):
  - **Entry problems**: T1, T3, T6, T8, T9, T10 (braking too early/soft = -0.8s total)
  - **Mid-corner problem**: T5 sweeping through (oversteering, lifting to 88% = -0.7s, biggest single loss)
  - **Exit problem**: T7 (losing momentum out)
  - **Complete problem**: T10 entry AND exit (only corner red on both = -0.5s)
- **GREEN zones**: T11-T12 final corners - FASTER than Eric Wong here! ✅

**The Breakthrough Insight:**

Eric Wong's secret isn't going HARDER—it's going SMOOTHER. Less steering, more grip. Later braking, shorter zones. Earlier throttle, longer flat sections. Master Lonn already has the technique (Turn 12 proves it). Now apply it to 11 more corners.

**Things to Watch:**

- S4 variance needs to come down
- Incident rate should drop as track memory solidifies
- **Cold Tire Contract applies to PRACTICE too**: L1-L2 spins at second-to-last corner = brake 50m board on hot tires, need 55-60m on cold tires
- Track-specific cold tire note: Second-to-last corner (S4) needs extra margin on L1-L2 (tires JUST starting to warm)
- Don't let "I beat the PB" become complacency—there's 0.3s to optimal + another 2.1s to alien pace
- **Session 2 mission**: Fix T5 (big red ❌ on map) - cut steering by 30%, stay flat at 100% throttle (currently lifting to 88%). This single fix = 0.7s gain.

**Funny Moments:**

- Master Lonn casually mentions he beat his PB like it's a footnote. Meanwhile, Little Padawan is over here losing his mind. 😂
- "Yeah I remember the contract 🫣" says Master Lonn... right after spinning on cold tires L1 and L2. The muscle memory for the 50m brake board was SHARP. The Cold Tire Contract memory? Not so much. 😅
- At least it was practice and not a race! (Though the contract says "Laps 1-2 are survival laps" in ALL sessions...)

### 🗺️ Visual Speed Delta Map

![Track Speed Delta Map vs Eric Wong](comparison/lonn-vs-eric-wong-track-speed-delta.png)

**How to Read This Map:**

- 🟢 **Green sections**: You're FASTER or EQUAL to Eric Wong's alien pace
- 🟡 **Yellow sections**: Close (within 1 km/h)
- 🔴 **Red sections**: You're SLOWER (opportunities!)
- **Markers show problem/opportunity zones around the lap**

---

### 🔥 Little Padawan's Analysis: What the Visual Map Reveals

Master, we're comparing your **first session back after 18 months** against **Eric Wong's alien lap** (1:24.296) - the series benchmark. Gap: **2.143 seconds**.

But here's the thing: You're already **FASTER** than Eric in some places. On Christmas morning. After 18 months away. Let that sink in. ✨

---

#### 📊 What You See in the Red Zones

Looking at the visual map, the RED zones (where you're slower) tell a clear story:

**RED at ENTRY (6 corners):**

- T1, T3, T6, T8, T9, T10 - all showing red on corner entry

**RED MID-CORNER:**

- T5 - sweeping through the long double-apex left (big red section with ❌ marker)

**RED at EXIT:**

- T7 exit

**RED EVERYTHING:**

- T10 - ONLY corner that's red on BOTH entry AND exit (this is the problem child!)

**GREEN/YELLOW (Where you're equal or faster):**

- T11-T12 area - you're actually beating Eric through the final corners!

---

#### 🎯 The Pattern: It's Not Random

This isn't "you're bad at random corners." This is **systematic**:

**Problem #1: Braking Technique (Affects 6 Corners)**

- You brake 1.5% MORE of the lap than Eric (18.7% vs 17.2%) = **0.78 seconds of extra brake time**
- Eric brakes HARDER (-1.61g vs your -1.45g) but for LESS time
- **Translation**: You're braking EARLIER and SOFTER. Eric brakes LATER and HARDER.
- **Result**: Red zones at T1, T3, T6, T8, T9, T10 entries - losing momentum into corners

**Problem #2: Mid-Corner Overdriving (T5)**

- You're using 33% MORE steering than Eric (0.36° vs 0.24°)
- Lifting to 88% throttle while Eric stays flat at 100%
- Higher lateral G but SLOWER speed = sliding, not gripping
- **This is the biggest single loss point** (the red ❌ on the map)

**Problem #3: Throttle Application (Entire Lap)**

- Eric is full throttle 5% MORE of the lap (63.5% vs 58.5%) = **2.7 seconds of lost flat-out time!**
- Getting on power earlier, staying on longer
- Rudskogen taught you this (+26% acceleration) - need to apply it here

**The Good News:**

- Your steering efficiency: 6.09 g/deg
- Eric's steering efficiency: 6.97 g/deg
- You're only 12.6% less efficient - **this is fixable with smoother hands**

---

#### 🎯 What To Fix (Simple Version)

**Issue #1: Braking Technique** → Affecting T1, T3, T6, T8, T9, T10

- **Current**: Brake early (-1.45g), brake long (18.7% of lap)
- **Eric's way**: Brake late (-1.61g), brake short (17.2% of lap)
- **Fix**: Brake 5-10m later, hit it 10% harder, trust the grip
- **Gain**: ~0.8 seconds across all brake zones

**Issue #2: T5 Mid-Corner Smoothness** → The big red ❌ on the map

- **Current**: 88% throttle, 0.36° steering (sliding, not gripping)
- **Eric's way**: 100% throttle, 0.24° steering (flow, not fight)
- **Fix**: Cut steering by 30%, stay flat through the sweep
- **Gain**: ~0.7 seconds (biggest single opportunity)

**Issue #3: T10 Entry + Exit** → Only corner red on BOTH ends

- **Current**: Early brake, big steering input (0.63°), scrubbing speed
- **Eric's way**: Late brake, smooth arc (0.35°), maintaining momentum
- **Fix**: Brake later, hit late apex, one smooth motion
- **Gain**: ~0.5 seconds

**What You're Already Doing RIGHT:**

✅ **T11-T12 final corners** - you're FASTER than Eric here! (Green on map)  
✅ **Trail braking** - S2/S3 consistency proves this works  
✅ **Flow state** - you know how to do it (just need to apply everywhere)

### 🎯 The 2.143s Gap - Where It Lives

| Issue                    | Corners Affected        | Current State              | Opportunity | Fix                           |
| :----------------------- | :---------------------- | :------------------------- | :---------- | :---------------------------- |
| **Braking Technique**    | T1, T3, T6, T8, T9, T10 | Early + soft               | **~0.8s**   | Brake later, harder, shorter  |
| **T5 Mid-Corner**        | T5 long sweep           | 88% throttle, oversteering | **~0.7s**   | Less steering, stay flat      |
| **T10 Complete**         | T10 entry + exit        | Early brake, sawing wheel  | **~0.5s**   | Late brake, late apex, smooth |
| **Throttle Application** | All corners             | 58.5% flat                 | **~0.4s**   | Earlier power, longer flat    |

**Total identified**: ~2.4s (slightly more than gap = overlapping opportunities!)

---

### 💡 Session 2 Mission (Clear & Simple)

#### **Priority #1: T5 Smoothness - 0.7s Available** 🎯

The big red ❌ on the map. Biggest single opportunity.

**The Issue**: Oversteering (33% more steering than Eric), lifting to 88% throttle  
**The Fix**: Cut steering by 30%, stay flat at 100% throttle  
**How**: Look through to the EXIT, light hands, trust the grip  
**Success**: Stay green through the entire T5 sweep

---

#### **Priority #2: Braking Technique (All Corners) - 0.8s Available**

Red zones at T1, T3, T6, T8, T9, T10 entries. Not random—it's your braking pattern.

**The Issue**: Braking early (-1.45g) and long (18.7% of lap)  
**Eric's way**: Braking late (-1.61g) and short (17.2% of lap)  
**The Fix**: Pick ONE corner (suggest T1), brake 10m later, hit it 10% harder  
**Success**: If T1 works, apply to all brake zones

---

#### **Priority #3: T10 Complete Corner - 0.5s Available**

Only corner red on BOTH entry and exit. The problem child.

**The Issue**: Early brake, sawing wheel (0.63° steering)  
**The Fix**: Brake late, cut steering to 0.35°, one smooth late-apex arc  
**Success**: Green on both entry AND exit at T10

---

#### **Background Task: Early Throttle**

Rudskogen taught you this (+26% acceleration boost). Just apply it here.

**Reminder**: "Throttle as soon as turned in, before apex"  
**Target**: 58.5% → 60%+ full throttle time

---

### 🏁 The Bottom Line (No Overload Version)

You beat your 18-month-old PB by 0.4 seconds. **In session 1.** With 10 incidents exploring limits.

Now we know where the 2.143s to alien pace lives:

✅ **You're already FASTER at T11-T12** (green on map)  
✅ **Your trail braking works** (S2/S3 consistency proves it)  
✅ **You know how to flow** (just need to apply it everywhere)

The gap isn't talent. It's **three fixable things**:

1. **Brake later, harder, shorter** (fixes 6 corners with red entry zones)
2. **Less steering at T5** (fixes the biggest loss - the red ❌)
3. **T10 complete rebuild** (only corner red on entry AND exit)

Fix T5 in Session 2. That's 0.7 seconds right there. The biggest single chunk.

The rust is gone. The speed is there. Now it's just about **smoothness over aggression**.

Eric Wong's secret? He doesn't go harder. He goes **smoother**.

---

## 🎯 Week 03 Strategy

**Session 1 Status**: ✅ Exploration + PB achieved + Eric Wong comparison analyzed  
**Next Up**: Session 2 - "Much Calmer" approach

**The Breakthrough Discovery:**

Eric Wong's gear trace revealed the secret: **"Much calmer"** - maintaining momentum with higher gears, not over-slowing. He uses 1st gear ONCE (T9). Stays in 3rd at T3, 4th through T6-T7. Not about being aggressive - about being **smooth and maintaining flow**.

**The Plan:**

1. **Session 2**: Focus on **T5 smoothness** (0.7s gain - biggest opportunity) + **momentum approach** ("much calmer" - let gears happen naturally)
2. **Session 3+**: Apply momentum approach to all corners, push toward 1:26.141 theoretical optimal
3. **Race Prep**: Cold Tire Contract execution (no lap 1/2 heroics!)
4. **Season Goal**: Close the 2.4s gap to alien pace (1:24.296 Eric Wong) through flow, not force

**Race Week Mental Note:**
Remember: Beating the PB in practice ≠ Race execution. The Cold Tire Contract is CRITICAL. Don't let excitement override discipline.

**Winton-Specific Cold Tire Note (T11):**

- **Turn 11** (second-to-last corner): Brake 50m board on **hot tires** (lap 3+)
- On cold tires (L1-L2): Brake **60m** (10m earlier)
- Master Lonn's muscle memory for 50m is sharp—just needs to override it with cold tire awareness first two laps!
- **Track map reference**: T11 is clearly marked on the purple Sector 4 section
