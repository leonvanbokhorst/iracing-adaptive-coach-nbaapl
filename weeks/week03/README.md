# Week 03 - Winton Motor Raceway (National) - Season 01 2026

**Track**: [Winton Motor Raceway - National Circuit](../../tracks/track-winton-motor-raceway-national.md)  
**Car**: [Ray FF1600](../../cars/car-ray-ff1600.md)  
**Dates**: December 25, 2025 → January 2, 2026  
**Status**: 📅 STARTING (new track, fresh challenge)

## The Mission

Third track of the season. New test: does the method transfer?

**Jefferson** (Week 01): New track → mastery in 3 weeks. Victory. Flow state. Mental resilience proven.

**Rudskogen** (Week 02): Rusty after 6 months → top 500 globally in 6 days. Pole position. Setup breakthrough. Strategic maturity confirmed.

**Winton** (Week 03): Completely new circuit. The tiebreaker. Does everything learned at Jefferson and Rudskogen transfer to unfamiliar ground?

## The Track

Winton Motor Raceway - National Circuit. 3.0 km of Australian dairy country turned race track. Dick Johnson once called it "running a marathon around your clothesline"—twelve corners linked by just enough straight to make you think you can relax before the next brake zone appears.

Short lap, long workload. Bumps into T3 and T10. Off-camber traps that punish greedy entries. Crosswinds across the infield that move your braking points by meters. The kind of place that rewards discipline and punishes overdriving.

In the Ray FF1600: a **discipline and traction exam** disguised as a tiny club circuit. Just enough power that every poor exit hurts. Not nearly enough to ignore the mistakes.

Perfect testing ground for everything learned in Weeks 01 and 02.

## The Plan

**Week 02 Pattern That Works:**

1. **First session**: Establish baseline, identify weak sector/corner
2. **Second session**: Find breakthrough technique for weak area (specific brake marker, gear sequence, vision)
3. **Practice sessions**: Build consistency at 95% of limit, don't overdrive
4. **Quali approach**: Pre-quali calm routine ("Calm mind first, fast lap second"), 95% pace flow > 100% pace forcing
5. **Race starts**: **COLD TIRE CONTRACT v2.0** - NO passing attempts lap 1-2, survive T1, hold line, wait until lap 3
6. **Mid-race**: Execute Position Secured Protocol (when goal achieved, back off 5%, finish clean)
7. **Incident management**: Incident = Survival Lap (mistake → next lap 95% pace to reset brain → then attack)
8. **Let PBs come naturally**: Don't chase times, let flow state deliver them

**Transferable Techniques from Week 02:**

- **Early throttle application** (+0.193g more acceleration, 26% increase)
- **Specific brake markers** (visual, repeatable, no guessing - ADHD brain friendly)
- **57.5% brake bias** (optimized for Master Lonn's style: trail braking, modulation, early throttle)
- **Strategic maturity** (Position Secured Protocol, Mental Reset after incidents)
- **Process over results** (diagnose root cause with data, apply fix, verify)

**The Only Frontier:**

Cold Tire Contract execution. Dec 24 proved this twice: qualify front row (P1, P2) → throw it away in first 90 seconds → then drive championship-level pace once warm.

Week 03 races: execute the contract from race 1. Survive lap 1-2 clean. NO passing attempts on cold tires. Let them go, wait for lap 3, THEN race.

## Week 03 Goals

**Technical:**

- [ ] Establish baseline lap time (first session)
- [ ] Identify weak sector/corner (data-driven focus)
- [ ] Find breakthrough technique (brake marker, line, vision)
- [ ] Build consistency (σ < 0.60s target in clean practice)
- [ ] Transfer 57.5% BB setup to Winton (or adjust if needed)

**Mental:**

- [ ] Execute Cold Tire Contract v2.0 from race 1 (NO passing attempts lap 1-2)
- [ ] Pre-quali calm routine (don't overdrive, 95% pace flow)
- [ ] Position Secured Protocol mid-race (when goal achieved, back off, finish)
- [ ] Mental Reset protocol after incidents (survival lap to reset brain)

**Strategic:**

- [ ] Apply Jefferson/Rudskogen method to new track
- [ ] Complete races clean (finish > heroics)
- [ ] Stack championship points
- [ ] Prove method is universal, not track-specific

## What We Bring From Week 02

**The Speed**: 1:28.508 race PB at Rudskogen, top 500 globally (505/2,179), +256 iRating

**The Setup**: 57.5% brake bias optimized for trail braking + early throttle style

**The Technique**: Early throttle application = 26% more acceleration, specific brake markers work

**The Mental Game**: Position Secured Protocol mastered, Mental Reset improving (2-3 laps), strategic maturity confirmed

**The Frontier**: Cold Tire Contract v2.0 needs execution from race 1

_Week 03: New track, same method. Jefferson proved it works. Rudskogen validated it transfers. Winton will confirm it's universal. Let's go. 🏎️💨_
